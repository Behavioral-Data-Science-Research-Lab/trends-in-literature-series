Sidener 1 Anjalee Nirgudkar 2 & Heather Pane 1 & Sharon A. Reeve 1 & Accepted: 18 September 2020/ # Association for Behavior Analysis International 2021 Published online: 14 January 2021 Abstract For most children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), manding for information is an important skill that must be systematically taught. Although previous studies have evaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies have demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of the present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant establishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem- plar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa- tion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios within a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to novel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time. Social validity for the intervention had an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7). Keywords Mand . Information . Trial-unique . Why Typically developing children are often proficient with many mands for information by preschool (Rowland & Pine, 2000; Sundberg, Loeb, Hale, & Eigenheer, 2002). The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) asserts that typically devel- oping children ask “why?” between 2 and 3 years of age and ask “when?” and “how?” between 4 and 5 years (ASHA, n.d.). Rowland, Pine, Lieven, and Theakston (2003) This study is based on a thesis submitted by the first author, under the supervision of the second author, to the Department of Applied Behavior Analysis at Caldwell University for the Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis. * Tina M. Sidener tsidener@caldwell.edu 1 Department of Applied Behavior Analysis, Caldwell University, 120 Bloomfield Ave., Caldwell, NJ 07006, USA 2 Behavior Analysts of New Jersey, Paramus, NJ, USA \\x0c2 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 state that “what?” and “where?” typically are learned first, followed by “who?” “when?” “how?” “why?” and lastly “which?” and “whose?” In contrast, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often need specific teaching to learn these skills. Although studies have evaluated procedures for teaching the mands “where?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Howlett, Sidener, Progar, & Sidener, 2011; Somers, Sidener, DeBar, & Sidener, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “what?” (e.g., Esbenshade & Rosales- Ruiz, 2001; Koegel, Koegel, Green-Hopkins, & Barnes, 2010; Williams, Donley, & Keller, 2000), “who?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Lechago, Carr, Grow, Love, & Almason, 2010; Shillingsburg, Bowen, Valentino, & Pierce, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “when?” (e.g., Landa, Hansen, & Shillingsburg, 2017; Shillingsburg, Valentino, Bowen, Bradley, & Zavatkey, 2011), and “how?” (e.g., Shillingsburg & Valentino, 2011), no studies to date have evaluated an intervention for teaching the mand for information “why?” to children with ASD. Research on teaching the mand “why?” may be limited for a number of reasons. First, it may be difficult to bring this mand under natural reinforcer control because the consequence (i.e., information about why) may not function as a reinforcer for some children with ASD. To address this issue when teaching other mands for information, most studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in access to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011), manding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to subsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred activity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?” resulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It may be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning the reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For example, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is information (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity. Second, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand “how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring that an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason for something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs for the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present. For example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the reason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that information as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse- quence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach the mand “why?” Despite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?” researchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of skill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the environment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and expand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described previously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three different EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 3 and typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa- tion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. In addition, we systematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa- tion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an alternative preferred item). To address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching opportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders, 2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of novel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve, Brothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children with ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial facilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel event on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?” Different topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g., “Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that manding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being generalized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we speculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would be more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what information to provide. We programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed generalization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. Main- tenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion. Finally, Board Certified Behavior Analysts and special education teachers were asked to assess the social validity of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study. Method Participants and Setting The participants were three children who had been previously diagnosed with ASD: Gianna (9 years, 11 months), Brandon (18 years, 4 months), and Ken (8 years, 1 month). All participants attended educational programs that provided comprehensive behavior- analytic instruction. They all demonstrated mastery of manding for preferred items, manding “where?”, imitating a question/phrase with at least five syllables, initiating joint attention with at least one type of response for two scenarios, and waiting 60 s for a preferred item when presented with the instruction “Wait.” Caregivers and instructors reported that the participants had not learned to mand “why?” and that this was an important skill for them to learn. Sessions were conducted in a room in a university- based autism center or in the participant’s home during teaching trials and in other settings in the participant’s natural environment (e.g., outside, library) during generalization probes. Preexperimental Assessments Preference assessment A questionnaire based on the Reinforcer Assessment for Indi- viduals With Severe Disabilities (Fisher, Piazza, Bowman, & Amari, 1996) was \\x0c4 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 administered to parents and teachers of each participant before the study to identify preferred items. The 12 highest ranked items were selected from a paired-stimulus preference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992). Teachers were also asked to identify an additional 12 items that were similar to the high-preference items (i.e., in the same category) to be used as alternative items during EO trials of the restricted access scenario. Access to all high-preference items was restricted to experimental sessions only. Skills assessments Four skills assessments were conducted to ensure participants demonstrated the skills necessary for inclusion in the study: repeating questions from a voice recorder, initiating joint attention, tacting emotions, and choosing preferred items from a pictorial choice board. All participants responded correctly and indepen- dently during all the following assessments such that no further teaching was required. The voice-recorder assessment evaluated whether the participants vocally imitated three questions played on a voice recorder to ensure the prerecorded prompt used in the study would evoke echoic responding (Somers et al., 2014). The questions used in this assessment had four, five, and six syllables (as the models in the study) but did not share any of the same words as the models in the study. The experimenter stood 0.5 m from the participant and played the recorded question for the participant to repeat. A correct response was defined as the participant emitting the complete question correctly and independently within 5 s. The joint attention assessment was used to evaluate whether participants initiated bids for joint attention, as this was a necessary skill for the observation of the unusual events scenario. A correct response was defined as the participant engaging in at least one of these responses within 3 min of an unusual event being encountered as the participant walked through the hallway or outside: pointing to or touching the unusual item, manding for attention (e.g., “Look!”), looking at the object and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). The tact assessment was used to evaluate whether the participants could tact emotions from facial expressions. The experimenter showed 14 photographs of two different people demonstrating seven different facial expressions (used during the study) and asked the participant “What is she/he doing?” A correct response was defined as the participant tacting the emotion correctly and independently within 5 s of the photograph being presented. The choice-board assessment evaluated whether the participants could make choices for preferred items from photographs on a choice board. The experimenter presented a choice board with an array of 12 photographs of items identified in the preference assessment and asked, “What do you want?” A correct response was defined as the participant selecting a picture from the choice board and giving it to the experimenter within 5 s (or pointing to a picture and vocally manding for it within 5 s), selecting the corresponding item from a box, and engaging with the item. Materials, Scenarios, and Scripts To identify scenarios likely to function as EOs for information about why something happened, we observed a classroom of 10 preschoolers who ranged from 2.5 to 4 years \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 5 old. The observation was conducted over 2 days, and each observation period lasted for 3 hr. The experimenter sat at the back of a classroom and observed the preschool students without interacting. Results showed that the most common antecedents to asking “why?” were seeing other children engaging in emotional responding (e.g., crying), and being denied access to preferred items and activities. Because of this, restricted access to preferred items and observation of emotional responses were selected as two of the scenarios to use in the current study for teaching the mand “why?” We also included a third scenario, unusual events, because the participants had demonstrated bids for joint attention to unusual events in the past. For the restricted access condition, 24 preferred items were used for each participant. For the unusual events condition, 60 different scenarios were used that were deemed to be salient and not likely to occur in the setting in which sessions were conducted (see Table 1 for examples). For the emotional responses condition, 48 videos depicting seven emotional responses and different reasons with four different people (i.e., each person recorded 12 videos; see Table 2 for examples) and 28 videos depicting routine actions/activities were used. Emotional responses were those that all participants could tact and were age appropriate. A voice recorder was used to provide echoic prompts. The scripts used were recorded with a peer of the same gender to provide a socially valid model, and an iPad was used to record all sessions for subsequent data collection. During the restricted access condition, a 30 cm × 35 cm laminated board, affixed with Velcro with 12 photographs of items on one side and three photographs of items used for generalization probe trials on the other side, was used as a choice board. A laptop computer was used to show videos during the emotional responses condition. Experimental Design and Data Collection A concurrent multiple-baseline design across three scenario types (i.e., restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events) was used to demonstrate the effects of the intervention with each participant. The order of scenario types was counterbalanced across participants (i.e., Gianna: restricted access, emotional re- sponses, unusual scenarios; Brandon: emotional responses, unusual scenarios, restricted access; Ken: unusual scenarios, restricted access, emotional responses). During each trial, the participant’s response was scored as correct or incorrect. A correct response during EO trials was defined as the participant independently saying the full mand for information (i.e., “Why is that there?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why can’t I have it?”) within 10 s of the unavailability statement, end of the video, or the participant indicating the unusual event. Equivalent mands (e.g., “Why is she laughing?”) were also scored as correct. Indicating an unusual event was defined as the participant pointing to it or touching it, manding for attention to it (e.g., “Look.”), looking at it and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). AO1 (Abolishing Operation 1) trials, in which the information/reason was immediately provided, and AO2 trials, in which the participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events, were scored as incorrect if the participant said “why” at any point during the trial. Data were summarized and graphed as the percentage of independent correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, generalization EO trials, generalization AO1 trials, and generalization AO2 trials per session. \\x0c6 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 Table 1 Examples of Unusual Scenarios Type Help Scenario Reason Action Pitcher of water on desk This was left over from watering the Let’s go dump it out.

Each session consisted of 12 trials: five EO trials, two AO1 trials, two AO2 trials, and generalization probe trials for EO, AO1, and AO2. Trials were quasi-randomly ordered every session, with no more than two EO trials in a row. The purpose of EO trials was to contrive an EO to teach the mand “why?” for the particular condition. The purpose of the AO1 and AO2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. During AO1 trials, participants were immediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is, they were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board, watched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in the environment, so there was no EO for manding “why?” A trial-unique procedure was used for all three scenarios to maintain the value of information for the mand “why?” Within each scenario, relevant features such as preferred items, unavailability statements, reasons, and alternative items (restricted access scenario); emotional responses, people, and reasons (emotional responses sce- nario); and unusual events, reasons, and related actions (unusual events scenario) were counterbalanced across trials and trial types so that manding would not come under the control of any specific features or combination of features. Baseline During all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the experimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items and said “Which one do you want?” or “Pick one.” During AO1 trials in baseline, when the participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail- ability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item. For example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “Oh! You can’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said “But you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. During AO2 trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to the item and said “Sure! You can have it.” During EO trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “You can’t have it.”). If the participant manded “Why can’t I have it?” within 10 s, the experimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next” and put the items away. During all trials in baseline sessions of the emotional responses scenario, the experimenter showed a video of someone engaging in an emotional response. During AO1 trials in baseline, 10 s after the video ended, the experimenter provided a reason using a tone and facial expression that matched the emotion and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, if a participant watched a video of a girl laughing, the experimenter paused the video and said “She’s laughing because someone tickled her!” and played the next part of the \\x0c8 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 video that showed someone tickling the girl. During AO2 trials in baseline, a video of someone engaging in a routine action with a neutral expression was shown to the participant. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant manded “Why is he/she doing that?” within 10 s of the video ending, the experimenter provided the reason as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.” During all trials of baseline sessions of the unusual events scenario, the experimenter walked with the participant to a different room or hallway or outside. During AO1 trials in baseline, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter provided a reason for it being there and an action related to it. For example, if a participant opened his or her backpack and found a pillow, the experimenter said “This says ‘Meghan’—Meghan must have left this here—let’s go put it in her office” and walked with the participant to Meghan’s office to put it there. During AO2 trials in baseline, there was nothing unusual in the environment. For example, when a participant walked into the classroom and there was nothing unusual, the participant continued with his or her daily schedule. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant correctly manded “Why is that there?” within 10 s, the experimenter immediately provided a reason and continued as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.” Mand training Training sessions were identical to baseline sessions with the following exceptions. During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, when the participant selected the item, the experimenter immediately provided an unavailability statement and played the recorded prompt “Why can’t I have it?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and offered an alternative item in a similar category. During EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, 10 s after the participant watched the video, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is he/she doing that?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided the reason and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, after the participant watched the first part of the video, which showed a boy hurt (i.e., saying “Ouch!”), and successfully echoed the recorded prompt, the experimenter immediately said “He’s hurt because the door shut on his finger!” and played the second part of the video showing the reason the boy was hurt (i.e., his finger getting caught in the door). During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is that there?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant engaged in the echoic, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and then suggested (a) helping to fix the situation, (b) playing with the item, or (c) nothing else. After meeting criterion during the full-script condition (i.e., 100% correct responding with or without scripts for two consecutive sessions), a baseline (no-script) probe was conducted to test for independent manding. If a participant responded at 100% accuracy for two consecutive sessions independently, the skill was considered mastered. Generalization To assess generalization, three generalization trials were conducted under baseline conditions during each session. These trials were conducted by novel \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 9 instructors or caregivers (i.e., familiar to the participant but not involved in the study) in novel settings (e.g., outside, on a walk, in the library). During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, we used a different colored choice board with photographs of three items that were not identified via the preference assessment but were nominated by teachers/caregivers as items that were manded for on a daily basis. During EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, a novel instructor acted out emotional responses in vivo. During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, novel unusual events occurred. For all AO1 and AO2 trials during generalization for all three scenarios, procedures similar to baseline were followed. Maintenance Maintenance probes were conducted 1 week after a participant reached the mastery criterion, and followed the same procedures as baseline. Instructors/ caregivers were asked to provide two opportunities to mand for each scenario for the EO condition and two opportunities for the AO1 and AO2 conditions each day between the conclusion of the study and the maintenance probe. Interobserver Agreement and Procedural Integrity Interobserver agreement (IOA) data were collected for 50% of baseline sessions, intervention sessions, and maintenance sessions. An agreement was defined as both observers recording a trial as correct or incorrect. IOA was calculated using point-by- point agreement by dividing the number of agreements over the total number of agreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100%. IOA was 100% for all three participants. Procedural integrity data were taken during 50% of all baseline, intervention, and maintenance sessions for all three participants by secondary observers via video recordings. A trial was scored as correct if all of the following were correct: statements, prompts, consequences, materials, and timing. Procedural integrity data were calculated by dividing the total number of correct trials over the total number of correct and incorrect trials and multiplying by 100%. Mean procedural integrity was 98% (range 97%–100%) for Brandon and 100% for Gianna and Ken. Social Validity Three special education teachers and two Board Certified Behavior Analysts were given brief descriptions of the procedures and shown videos of each condition. They completed a modified Treatment Acceptability Rating Form–Revised (TARF-R; Reimers & Wacker, 1988), which uses a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = disagree strongly; 7 = agree strongly). Results Data on the percentage of correct responses for all participants are presented in Figs. 1 through 3. As can be seen in Fig. 1, during baseline Gianna responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training \\x0c10 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 in the restricted access to preferred items condition (top panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. Although she did not ask “why?” during two EO trials (Sessions 13 and 15), asked “where’s [item]?” during one AO1 trial (Session 14), and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 15), no procedural modifications were needed. When the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in two sessions. During mand training in the emotional responses condition (middle panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. When the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in three sessions. During mand training in the unusual events condition (bottom panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script and with the script removed in two sessions each. As can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, during baseline of the emotional responses condition, Brandon responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. He did not ask “why?” during five EO trials (Sessions 11 and 17) and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 17). He reached the mastery criterion with the full script in five sessions and with the script removed in three sessions. A similar pattern was observed in the unusual events condition (middle panel): He reached the mastery criterion with the full script in four sessions and with the script removed in two sessions. A different pattern was observed during the restricted access condition. Although his caregivers reported that he had not previously learned to mand “why?” and he did not mand “why?” during baseline of the other conditions, during the first four sessions of baseline of the restricted access condition (bottom panel), Brandon manded “why not?” “how come?” and “why can’t I have [item]?” during 50% of EO trials. However, he also made errors during 50% of EO trials, 50% of AO1 trials, and 100% of EO generalization trials of those sessions (i.e., for the AO1 trials, Brandon manded “why?” even when the instructor provided a reason, and for the EO trials and the EO generalization trials, Brandon did not mand “why?”). After reaching the mastery criterion in the emotional responses condition (i.e., top panel), he subsequently scored 100% during all trials of the next four sessions in the restricted access condition without teaching. As can be seen in Fig. 3, during baseline Ken responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training in the unusual events condition (top panel), he reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in five sessions and for the no-script condition in four sessions. During this scenario, Ken asked “why?” during two AO1 trials (Sessions 10 and 17). During mand training in the restricted access condition (middle panel), Ken reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in three sessions and for the no-script condition in two sessions. Similarly, in the emotional responses condition, he reached the mastery criterion for both the full-script and no-script conditions in two sessions each. As with acquisition, all participants demonstrated generalized manding quickly. Only one participant, Ken, made an error during a generalization trial of the no-script condition. During Session 18, during the AO1 trial, after the experimenter provided the reason for the unusual event, Ken asked “Where should the star bucket go?” Interestingly, during the full-script condition of the emotional responses condition, Gianna initially engaged in errors during generalization EO trials and generalization AO1 trials and responded with laughter and stereotypy (e.g., when the novel instructor acted out the scenario for surprise, Gianna started laughing and talking about a cartoon video clip). Subsequently, a procedural modification was made during Sessions 23, 24, and 25 to temporarily make the generalization conditions (i.e., in vivo presentation of emotional responding) more like the teaching conditions (i.e., \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 11 Baseline       Full Script No Script      Maintenance 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 s e s n o p s e R t c e r r o C t n e d n e p e d n I h t i w s l a i r T f o e g a t n e c r e P Restricted Access Emotional Responses 0 1 6 EO 11 16 21 Sessions 26 31 36 41 AO2 Gen EO Gen AO1 Gen AO2 AO1 Unusual Scenarios Fig. 1 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes across each scenario for Gianna video presentation of emotional responding). To do this, a novel instructor (in a novel setting) held the laptop computer facing the participant and played a training video of emotional responding. Following Session 25, this modification was removed, and Gianna subsequently met the mastery criterion within two sessions. All skills remained at 100% correct for all participants during maintenance probes 1 week later. On the modified TARF-R, respondents rated the social validity of the intervention with an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7). Discussion The purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to three children with ASD.

To our knowledge, this is the first published study to evaluate procedures for teaching this skill to this population. These findings replicate and extend other research on teaching mands for information that contrived EO and AO trials (e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Shillingsburg & Valentino, 2011). The current study included three types of scenarios—restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events—to teach the mand “why?” These scenarios were selected based on observation of typically developing children and the participants. Future studies might evaluate other types of scenarios that might evoke the mand “why?” Although we conducted a descriptive assessment with preschool children over 2 days (6 hr), we only observed two types of antecedents for this mand. It is \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 13 Baseline Full Script No Script Maintenance GAO2 AO2 EO GEO GAO AO 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 s e s n o p s e R t c e r r o C t n e d n e p e d n I h t i w s l a i r T f o e g a t n e c r e P Unusual Scenarios Restricted Access Emotional Responses 0 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 Sessions Fig. 3 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes across each scenario for Ken possible that observing a different age group in different settings could assist in identifying other important EOs for manding “why?” in typically developing children. It would also be helpful for behavior analysts to collect objective data on topographies and common antecedents and consequences of this mand (and other mands for information) as they emerge in typically developing children. This might contribute to a more thorough understanding of the functions of these mands and how we might teach them more effectively and efficiently to children with ASD. Finally, clinicians might take advantage of EOs specific to their clients to teach this mand. For example, some children with ASD who experience changes in their routine as particularly aversive may have a strong EO for learning about reasons for those changes. Trial-unique multiple-exemplar training was used to promote accurate stimulus/EO control and generalization. First, in the restricted access condition, 12 preferred items and a minimum of three unavailability statements were used. Second, in the emotional responses \\x0c14 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 condition, four different peers and seven different emotions were used. Third, in the unusual events condition, four different locations and 60 different events were used. Although this required much planning and time, this cost may be deemed worth the benefit of rapid acquisition, generalization, maintenance, and accurate EO control of this mand. Future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more efficiently. For example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide different reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the ceiling). However, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular scenario, the participant may not have an EO to mand “why?” in the future for the same/similar scenario. Additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant to continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided. To bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information as the consequence for the mand. However, we speculated that we might be able to enhance the value of the consequences we provided; we did this in different ways in each condition. In the restricted access condition, during EO and AO1 trials, although participants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in the same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). In the emotional responding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the number of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other students, and to increase attending. We also thought pausing the video after showing the emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the responding would be particularly reinforcing. Finally, in the unusual events condition, we delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people ask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem. Clinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and consequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer control. The purpose of having two AO conditions rather than just one as in previous studies (e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under the control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. The two AO conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced- ent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. During AO1 trials, participants were provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were immediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response or unusual scenario so there was no EO for manding “why?” We deemed this important for promoting EO control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. Future studies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. A second function of the AO2 trials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access condition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific items they manded for. That is, without AO2 trials, manding would have always resulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only have alternative items. This would not have resembled the natural environment and could have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts. All participants mastered the mand “why?” after the full-script condition, and it was unnecessary to use the partial- \\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 15 script condition for any of the participants. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts, rather than in vivo vocal models, as it has been suggested that the former may be easier to fade (Howlett et al., 2011). Future studies might compare the effectiveness, efficiency, and social validity of these types of prompts. It should be noted that all participants in the current study had prior exposure to prompts via voice recorders and to choice boards and also displayed specific skills relevant to the scenarios (i.e., joint attention, tacting emotional responses). Clinicians should assess necessary prerequisite skills for potential learners, as it may help with faster and efficient skill acquisition and also help with effective prompts and prompt-fading strategies. For all participants, manding “why?” maintained 1 week after mastery. During the week between mastery and the maintenance probe, teachers provided at least two opportunities to practice manding “why?” each day to assist with maintenance over time. Successful maintenance may have resulted from teaching during the study and/or practicing during the week. Social validity was assessed via a modified version of the TARF-R (Reimers & Wacker, 1988) and indicated that the procedures used in this study were time consum- ing for the experimenter but acceptable to achieve the desired results. Although the procedures for the current study were complex, all participants acquired the mand “why?” in all three scenarios and also maintained the skill after 1 week. The total number of sessions for all three participants did not exceed 21 sessions. Compliance with Ethical Standards Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Reeve 1 & Accepted: 18 September 2020/ # Association for Behavior Analysis International 2021 Published online: 14 January 2021 Abstract For most children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), manding for information is an important skill that must be systematically taught. Although previous studies have evaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies have demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of the present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant establishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem- plar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa- tion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios within a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to novel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time. Social validity for the intervention had an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7). Keywords Mand . Information . Trial-unique . Why Typically developing children are often proficient with many mands for information by preschool (Rowland & Pine, 2000; Sundberg, Loeb, Hale, & Eigenheer, 2002). The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) asserts that typically devel- oping children ask “why?” between 2 and 3 years of age and ask “when?” and “how?” between 4 and 5 years (ASHA, n.d.). Rowland, Pine, Lieven, and Theakston (2003) This study is based on a thesis submitted by the first author, under the supervision of the second author, to the Department of Applied Behavior Analysis at Caldwell University for the Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis. * Tina M. Sidener tsidener@caldwell.edu 1 Department of Applied Behavior Analysis, Caldwell University, 120 Bloomfield Ave., Caldwell, NJ 07006, USA 2 Behavior Analysts of New Jersey, Paramus, NJ, USA '2 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 state that “what?” and “where?” typically are learned first, followed by “who?” “when?” “how?” “why?” and lastly “which?” and “whose?” In contrast, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often need specific teaching to learn these skills. Although studies have evaluated procedures for teaching the mands “where?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Howlett, Sidener, Progar, & Sidener, 2011; Somers, Sidener, DeBar, & Sidener, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “what?” (e.g., Esbenshade & Rosales- Ruiz, 2001; Koegel, Koegel, Green-Hopkins, & Barnes, 2010; Williams, Donley, & Keller, 2000), “who?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Lechago, Carr, Grow, Love, & Almason, 2010; Shillingsburg, Bowen, Valentino, & Pierce, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “when?” (e.g., Landa, Hansen, & Shillingsburg, 2017; Shillingsburg, Valentino, Bowen, Bradley, & Zavatkey, 2011), and “how?” (e.g., Shillingsburg & Valentino, 2011), no studies to date have evaluated an intervention for teaching the mand for information “why?” to children with ASD. Research on teaching the mand “why?” may be limited for a number of reasons. First, it may be difficult to bring this mand under natural reinforcer control because the consequence (i.e., information about why) may not function as a reinforcer for some children with ASD. To address this issue when teaching other mands for information, most studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in access to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011), manding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to subsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred activity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?” resulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It may be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning the reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For example, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is information (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity. Second, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand “how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring that an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason for something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs for the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present. For example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the reason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that information as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse- quence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach the mand “why?” Despite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?” researchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of skill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the environment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and expand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described previously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three different EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 3 and typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa- tion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. In addition, we systematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa- tion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an alternative preferred item). To address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching opportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders, 2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of novel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve, Brothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children with ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial facilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel event on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?” Different topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g., “Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that manding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being generalized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we speculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would be more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what information to provide. We programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed generalization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. Main- tenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion. Finally, Board Certified Behavior Analysts and special education teachers were asked to assess the social validity of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study. Method Participants and Setting The participants were three children who had been previously diagnosed with ASD: Gianna (9 years, 11 months), Brandon (18 years, 4 months), and Ken (8 years, 1 month). All participants attended educational programs that provided comprehensive behavior- analytic instruction. They all demonstrated mastery of manding for preferred items, manding “where?”, imitating a question/phrase with at least five syllables, initiating joint attention with at least one type of response for two scenarios, and waiting 60 s for a preferred item when presented with the instruction “Wait.” Caregivers and instructors reported that the participants had not learned to mand “why?” and that this was an important skill for them to learn. Sessions were conducted in a room in a university- based autism center or in the participant’s home during teaching trials and in other settings in the participant’s natural environment (e.g., outside, library) during generalization probes. Preexperimental Assessments Preference assessment A questionnaire based on the Reinforcer Assessment for Indi- viduals With Severe Disabilities (Fisher, Piazza, Bowman, & Amari, 1996) was '4 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 administered to parents and teachers of each participant before the study to identify preferred items. The 12 highest ranked items were selected from a paired-stimulus preference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992). Teachers were also asked to identify an additional 12 items that were similar to the high-preference items (i.e., in the same category) to be used as alternative items during EO trials of the restricted access scenario. Access to all high-preference items was restricted to experimental sessions only. Skills assessments Four skills assessments were conducted to ensure participants demonstrated the skills necessary for inclusion in the study: repeating questions from a voice recorder, initiating joint attention, tacting emotions, and choosing preferred items from a pictorial choice board. All participants responded correctly and indepen- dently during all the following assessments such that no further teaching was required. The voice-recorder assessment evaluated whether the participants vocally imitated three questions played on a voice recorder to ensure the prerecorded prompt used in the study would evoke echoic responding (Somers et al., 2014). The questions used in this assessment had four, five, and six syllables (as the models in the study) but did not share any of the same words as the models in the study. The experimenter stood 0.5 m from the participant and played the recorded question for the participant to repeat. A correct response was defined as the participant emitting the complete question correctly and independently within 5 s. The joint attention assessment was used to evaluate whether participants initiated bids for joint attention, as this was a necessary skill for the observation of the unusual events scenario. A correct response was defined as the participant engaging in at least one of these responses within 3 min of an unusual event being encountered as the participant walked through the hallway or outside: pointing to or touching the unusual item, manding for attention (e.g., “Look!”), looking at the object and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). The tact assessment was used to evaluate whether the participants could tact emotions from facial expressions. The experimenter showed 14 photographs of two different people demonstrating seven different facial expressions (used during the study) and asked the participant “What is she/he doing?” A correct response was defined as the participant tacting the emotion correctly and independently within 5 s of the photograph being presented. The choice-board assessment evaluated whether the participants could make choices for preferred items from photographs on a choice board. The experimenter presented a choice board with an array of 12 photographs of items identified in the preference assessment and asked, “What do you want?” A correct response was defined as the participant selecting a picture from the choice board and giving it to the experimenter within 5 s (or pointing to a picture and vocally manding for it within 5 s), selecting the corresponding item from a box, and engaging with the item. Materials, Scenarios, and Scripts To identify scenarios likely to function as EOs for information about why something happened, we observed a classroom of 10 preschoolers who ranged from 2.5 to 4 years 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 5 old. The observation was conducted over 2 days, and each observation period lasted for 3 hr. The experimenter sat at the back of a classroom and observed the preschool students without interacting. Results showed that the most common antecedents to asking “why?” were seeing other children engaging in emotional responding (e.g., crying), and being denied access to preferred items and activities. Because of this, restricted access to preferred items and observation of emotional responses were selected as two of the scenarios to use in the current study for teaching the mand “why?” We also included a third scenario, unusual events, because the participants had demonstrated bids for joint attention to unusual events in the past. For the restricted access condition, 24 preferred items were used for each participant. For the unusual events condition, 60 different scenarios were used that were deemed to be salient and not likely to occur in the setting in which sessions were conducted (see Table 1 for examples). For the emotional responses condition, 48 videos depicting seven emotional responses and different reasons with four different people (i.e., each person recorded 12 videos; see Table 2 for examples) and 28 videos depicting routine actions/activities were used. Emotional responses were those that all participants could tact and were age appropriate. A voice recorder was used to provide echoic prompts. The scripts used were recorded with a peer of the same gender to provide a socially valid model, and an iPad was used to record all sessions for subsequent data collection. During the restricted access condition, a 30 cm × 35 cm laminated board, affixed with Velcro with 12 photographs of items on one side and three photographs of items used for generalization probe trials on the other side, was used as a choice board. A laptop computer was used to show videos during the emotional responses condition. Experimental Design and Data Collection A concurrent multiple-baseline design across three scenario types (i.e., restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events) was used to demonstrate the effects of the intervention with each participant. The order of scenario types was counterbalanced across participants (i.e., Gianna: restricted access, emotional re- sponses, unusual scenarios; Brandon: emotional responses, unusual scenarios, restricted access; Ken: unusual scenarios, restricted access, emotional responses). During each trial, the participant’s response was scored as correct or incorrect. A correct response during EO trials was defined as the participant independently saying the full mand for information (i.e., “Why is that there?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why can’t I have it?”) within 10 s of the unavailability statement, end of the video, or the participant indicating the unusual event. Equivalent mands (e.g., “Why is she laughing?”) were also scored as correct. Indicating an unusual event was defined as the participant pointing to it or touching it, manding for attention to it (e.g., “Look.”), looking at it and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). AO1 (Abolishing Operation 1) trials, in which the information/reason was immediately provided, and AO2 trials, in which the participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events, were scored as incorrect if the participant said “why” at any point during the trial. Data were summarized and graphed as the percentage of independent correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, generalization EO trials, generalization AO1 trials, and generalization AO2 trials per session.

'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 7 Experimental Procedure Sessions were conducted up to three times per day, 4–5 days per week. Each session consisted of 12 trials: five EO trials, two AO1 trials, two AO2 trials, and generalization probe trials for EO, AO1, and AO2. Trials were quasi-randomly ordered every session, with no more than two EO trials in a row. The purpose of EO trials was to contrive an EO to teach the mand “why?” for the particular condition. The purpose of the AO1 and AO2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. During AO1 trials, participants were immediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is, they were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board, watched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in the environment, so there was no EO for manding “why?” A trial-unique procedure was used for all three scenarios to maintain the value of information for the mand “why?” Within each scenario, relevant features such as preferred items, unavailability statements, reasons, and alternative items (restricted access scenario); emotional responses, people, and reasons (emotional responses sce- nario); and unusual events, reasons, and related actions (unusual events scenario) were counterbalanced across trials and trial types so that manding would not come under the control of any specific features or combination of features. Baseline During all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the experimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items and said “Which one do you want?” or “Pick one.” During AO1 trials in baseline, when the participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail- ability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item. For example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “Oh! You can’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said “But you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. During AO2 trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to the item and said “Sure! You can have it.” During EO trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “You can’t have it.”). If the participant manded “Why can’t I have it?” within 10 s, the experimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next” and put the items away. During all trials in baseline sessions of the emotional responses scenario, the experimenter showed a video of someone engaging in an emotional response. During AO1 trials in baseline, 10 s after the video ended, the experimenter provided a reason using a tone and facial expression that matched the emotion and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, if a participant watched a video of a girl laughing, the experimenter paused the video and said “She’s laughing because someone tickled her!” and played the next part of the '8 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 video that showed someone tickling the girl. During AO2 trials in baseline, a video of someone engaging in a routine action with a neutral expression was shown to the participant. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant manded “Why is he/she doing that?” within 10 s of the video ending, the experimenter provided the reason as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.” During all trials of baseline sessions of the unusual events scenario, the experimenter walked with the participant to a different room or hallway or outside. During AO1 trials in baseline, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter provided a reason for it being there and an action related to it. For example, if a participant opened his or her backpack and found a pillow, the experimenter said “This says ‘Meghan’—Meghan must have left this here—let’s go put it in her office” and walked with the participant to Meghan’s office to put it there. During AO2 trials in baseline, there was nothing unusual in the environment. For example, when a participant walked into the classroom and there was nothing unusual, the participant continued with his or her daily schedule. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant correctly manded “Why is that there?” within 10 s, the experimenter immediately provided a reason and continued as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.” Mand training Training sessions were identical to baseline sessions with the following exceptions. During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, when the participant selected the item, the experimenter immediately provided an unavailability statement and played the recorded prompt “Why can’t I have it?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and offered an alternative item in a similar category. During EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, 10 s after the participant watched the video, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is he/she doing that?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided the reason and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, after the participant watched the first part of the video, which showed a boy hurt (i.e., saying “Ouch!”), and successfully echoed the recorded prompt, the experimenter immediately said “He’s hurt because the door shut on his finger!” and played the second part of the video showing the reason the boy was hurt (i.e., his finger getting caught in the door). During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is that there?” out of the participant’s view. After the participant engaged in the echoic, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and then suggested (a) helping to fix the situation, (b) playing with the item, or (c) nothing else. After meeting criterion during the full-script condition (i.e., 100% correct responding with or without scripts for two consecutive sessions), a baseline (no-script) probe was conducted to test for independent manding. If a participant responded at 100% accuracy for two consecutive sessions independently, the skill was considered mastered. Generalization To assess generalization, three generalization trials were conducted under baseline conditions during each session. These trials were conducted by novel 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 9 instructors or caregivers (i.e., familiar to the participant but not involved in the study) in novel settings (e.g., outside, on a walk, in the library). During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, we used a different colored choice board with photographs of three items that were not identified via the preference assessment but were nominated by teachers/caregivers as items that were manded for on a daily basis. During EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, a novel instructor acted out emotional responses in vivo. During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, novel unusual events occurred. For all AO1 and AO2 trials during generalization for all three scenarios, procedures similar to baseline were followed. Maintenance Maintenance probes were conducted 1 week after a participant reached the mastery criterion, and followed the same procedures as baseline. Instructors/ caregivers were asked to provide two opportunities to mand for each scenario for the EO condition and two opportunities for the AO1 and AO2 conditions each day between the conclusion of the study and the maintenance probe. Interobserver Agreement and Procedural Integrity Interobserver agreement (IOA) data were collected for 50% of baseline sessions, intervention sessions, and maintenance sessions. An agreement was defined as both observers recording a trial as correct or incorrect. IOA was calculated using point-by- point agreement by dividing the number of agreements over the total number of agreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100%. IOA was 100% for all three participants. Procedural integrity data were taken during 50% of all baseline, intervention, and maintenance sessions for all three participants by secondary observers via video recordings. A trial was scored as correct if all of the following were correct: statements, prompts, consequences, materials, and timing. Procedural integrity data were calculated by dividing the total number of correct trials over the total number of correct and incorrect trials and multiplying by 100%. Mean procedural integrity was 98% (range 97%–100%) for Brandon and 100% for Gianna and Ken. Social Validity Three special education teachers and two Board Certified Behavior Analysts were given brief descriptions of the procedures and shown videos of each condition. They completed a modified Treatment Acceptability Rating Form–Revised (TARF-R; Reimers & Wacker, 1988), which uses a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = disagree strongly; 7 = agree strongly). Results Data on the percentage of correct responses for all participants are presented in Figs. 1 through 3. As can be seen in Fig. 1, during baseline Gianna responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training '10 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 in the restricted access to preferred items condition (top panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. Although she did not ask “why?” during two EO trials (Sessions 13 and 15), asked “where’s [item]?” during one AO1 trial (Session 14), and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 15), no procedural modifications were needed. When the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in two sessions. During mand training in the emotional responses condition (middle panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. When the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in three sessions. During mand training in the unusual events condition (bottom panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script and with the script removed in two sessions each. As can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, during baseline of the emotional responses condition, Brandon responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. He did not ask “why?” during five EO trials (Sessions 11 and 17) and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 17). He reached the mastery criterion with the full script in five sessions and with the script removed in three sessions. A similar pattern was observed in the unusual events condition (middle panel): He reached the mastery criterion with the full script in four sessions and with the script removed in two sessions. A different pattern was observed during the restricted access condition. Although his caregivers reported that he had not previously learned to mand “why?” and he did not mand “why?” during baseline of the other conditions, during the first four sessions of baseline of the restricted access condition (bottom panel), Brandon manded “why not?” “how come?” and “why can’t I have [item]?” during 50% of EO trials. However, he also made errors during 50% of EO trials, 50% of AO1 trials, and 100% of EO generalization trials of those sessions (i.e., for the AO1 trials, Brandon manded “why?” even when the instructor provided a reason, and for the EO trials and the EO generalization trials, Brandon did not mand “why?”). After reaching the mastery criterion in the emotional responses condition (i.e., top panel), he subsequently scored 100% during all trials of the next four sessions in the restricted access condition without teaching. As can be seen in Fig. 3, during baseline Ken responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training in the unusual events condition (top panel), he reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in five sessions and for the no-script condition in four sessions. During this scenario, Ken asked “why?” during two AO1 trials (Sessions 10 and 17). During mand training in the restricted access condition (middle panel), Ken reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in three sessions and for the no-script condition in two sessions. Similarly, in the emotional responses condition, he reached the mastery criterion for both the full-script and no-script conditions in two sessions each. As with acquisition, all participants demonstrated generalized manding quickly. Only one participant, Ken, made an error during a generalization trial of the no-script condition. During Session 18, during the AO1 trial, after the experimenter provided the reason for the unusual event, Ken asked “Where should the star bucket go?” Interestingly, during the full-script condition of the emotional responses condition, Gianna initially engaged in errors during generalization EO trials and generalization AO1 trials and responded with laughter and stereotypy (e.g., when the novel instructor acted out the scenario for surprise, Gianna started laughing and talking about a cartoon video clip). Subsequently, a procedural modification was made during Sessions 23, 24, and 25 to temporarily make the generalization conditions (i.e., in vivo presentation of emotional responding) more like the teaching conditions (i.e., 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 11 Baseline       Full Script No Script      Maintenance 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 s e s n o p s e R t c e r r o C t n e d n e p e d n I h t i w s l a i r T f o e g a t n e c r e P Restricted Access Emotional Responses 0 1 6 EO 11 16 21 Sessions 26 31 36 41 AO2 Gen EO Gen AO1 Gen AO2 AO1 Unusual Scenarios Fig. 1 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes across each scenario for Gianna video presentation of emotional responding). To do this, a novel instructor (in a novel setting) held the laptop computer facing the participant and played a training video of emotional responding. Following Session 25, this modification was removed, and Gianna subsequently met the mastery criterion within two sessions. All skills remained at 100% correct for all participants during maintenance probes 1 week later. On the modified TARF-R, respondents rated the social validity of the intervention with an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7). Discussion The purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to three children with ASD. All participants learned and maintained a repertoire of '12 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 Baseline Full Script No Script Maintenance EO AO2 GEO GAO GAO 2 AO s e s n o p s e R t c e r r o C t n e d n e p e d n I h t i w s l a i r T f o e g a t n e c r e P 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 Emotional Unusual 0 1 6 11 16 21 26 Sessions Restricted Access Fig. 2 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes across each scenario for Brandon manding in three distinct situations and demonstrated generalization with novel stimuli, instructors, and locations in the following number of teaching (full-script plus no-script) sessions and trials: Gianna in 21 sessions, 252 trials; Brandon in 4 sessions, 168 trials; and Ken in 18 sessions, 216 trials. To our knowledge, this is the first published study to evaluate procedures for teaching this skill to this population. These findings replicate and extend other research on teaching mands for information that contrived EO and AO trials (e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Shillingsburg & Valentino, 2011). The current study included three types of scenarios—restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events—to teach the mand “why?” These scenarios were selected based on observation of typically developing children and the participants. Future studies might evaluate other types of scenarios that might evoke the mand “why?” Although we conducted a descriptive assessment with preschool children over 2 days (6 hr), we only observed two types of antecedents for this mand. It is 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 13 Baseline Full Script No Script Maintenance GAO2 AO2 EO GEO GAO AO 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 0 100 75 50 25 s e s n o p s e R t c e r r o C t n e d n e p e d n I h t i w s l a i r T f o e g a t n e c r e P Unusual Scenarios Restricted Access Emotional Responses 0 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 Sessions Fig. 3 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes across each scenario for Ken possible that observing a different age group in different settings could assist in identifying other important EOs for manding “why?” in typically developing children. It would also be helpful for behavior analysts to collect objective data on topographies and common antecedents and consequences of this mand (and other mands for information) as they emerge in typically developing children. This might contribute to a more thorough understanding of the functions of these mands and how we might teach them more effectively and efficiently to children with ASD. Finally, clinicians might take advantage of EOs specific to their clients to teach this mand. For example, some children with ASD who experience changes in their routine as particularly aversive may have a strong EO for learning about reasons for those changes. Trial-unique multiple-exemplar training was used to promote accurate stimulus/EO control and generalization. First, in the restricted access condition, 12 preferred items and a minimum of three unavailability statements were used. Second, in the emotional responses '14 The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 condition, four different peers and seven different emotions were used. Third, in the unusual events condition, four different locations and 60 different events were used. Although this required much planning and time, this cost may be deemed worth the benefit of rapid acquisition, generalization, maintenance, and accurate EO control of this mand. Future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more efficiently. For example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide different reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the ceiling). However, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular scenario, the participant may not have an EO to mand “why?” in the future for the same/similar scenario. Additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant to continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided. To bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information as the consequence for the mand. However, we speculated that we might be able to enhance the value of the consequences we provided; we did this in different ways in each condition. In the restricted access condition, during EO and AO1 trials, although participants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in the same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). In the emotional responding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the number of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other students, and to increase attending. We also thought pausing the video after showing the emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the responding would be particularly reinforcing. Finally, in the unusual events condition, we delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people ask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem. Clinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and consequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer control. The purpose of having two AO conditions rather than just one as in previous studies (e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under the control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. The two AO conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced- ent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. During AO1 trials, participants were provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were immediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response or unusual scenario so there was no EO for manding “why?” We deemed this important for promoting EO control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. Future studies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. A second function of the AO2 trials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access condition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific items they manded for. That is, without AO2 trials, manding would have always resulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only have alternative items. This would not have resembled the natural environment and could have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts. All participants mastered the mand “why?” after the full-script condition, and it was unnecessary to use the partial- 'The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16 15 script condition for any of the participants. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts, rather than in vivo vocal models, as it has been suggested that the former may be easier to fade (Howlett et al., 2011). Future studies might compare the effectiveness, efficiency, and social validity of these types of prompts. It should be noted that all participants in the current study had prior exposure to prompts via voice recorders and to choice boards and also displayed specific skills relevant to the scenarios (i.e., joint attention, tacting emotional responses). Clinicians should assess necessary prerequisite skills for potential learners, as it may help with faster and efficient skill acquisition and also help with effective prompts and prompt-fading strategies. For all participants, manding “why?” maintained 1 week after mastery. During the week between mastery and the maintenance probe, teachers provided at least two opportunities to practice manding “why?” each day to assist with maintenance over time. Successful maintenance may have resulted from teaching during the study and/or practicing during the week. Social validity was assessed via a modified version of the TARF-R (Reimers & Wacker, 1988) and indicated that the procedures used in this study were time consum- ing for the experimenter but acceptable to achieve the desired results. Although the procedures for the current study were complex, all participants acquired the mand “why?” in all three scenarios and also maintained the skill after 1 week. The total number of sessions for all three participants did not exceed 21 sessions. Compliance with Ethical Standards Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Although previous studies have\\nevaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies\\nhave demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of\\nthe present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant\\nestablishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem-\\nplar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa-\\ntion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios\\nwithin a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to\\nnovel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time.

       " 'state that “what?” and “where?” typically are learned first, followed by “who?”\\n“when?” “how?” “why?” and lastly “which?” and “whose?” In contrast, children with\\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD) often need specific teaching to learn these skills.\\nAlthough studies have evaluated procedures for teaching the mands “where?” (e.g.,\\nEndicott & Higbee, 2007; Howlett, Sidener, Progar, & Sidener, 2011; Somers, Sidener,\\nDeBar, & Sidener, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “what?” (e.g., Esbenshade & Rosales-\\nRuiz, 2001; Koegel, Koegel, Green-Hopkins, & Barnes, 2010; Williams, Donley, &\\nKeller, 2000), “who?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Lechago, Carr, Grow, Love, &\\nAlmason, 2010; Shillingsburg, Bowen, Valentino, & Pierce, 2014; Sundberg et al.,\\n2002), “when?” (e.g., Landa, Hansen, & Shillingsburg, 2017; Shillingsburg, Valentino,\\nBowen, Bradley, & Zavatkey, 2011), and “how?” (e.g., Shillingsburg & Valentino,\\n2011), no studies to date have evaluated an intervention for teaching the mand for\\ninformation “why?” to children with ASD.',\n",
       " 'Research on teaching the mand “why?” may be limited for a number of reasons.\\nFirst, it may be difficult to bring this mand under natural reinforcer control because the\\nconsequence (i.e., information about why) may not function as a reinforcer for some\\nchildren with ASD. To address this issue when teaching other mands for information,\\nmost studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in\\naccess to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011),\\nmanding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to\\nsubsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred\\nactivity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?”\\nresulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It\\nmay be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning\\nthe reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For\\nexample, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in\\nthe middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is\\ninformation (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity.',\n",
       " 'Second, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand\\n“how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring\\nthat an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason\\nfor something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs\\nfor the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present.\\nFor example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the\\nreason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that\\ninformation as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse-\\nquence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach\\nthe mand “why?”',\n",
       " 'Despite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?”\\nresearchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of\\nskill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the\\nenvironment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and\\nexpand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore,\\nthe purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand\\n“why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described\\npreviously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three\\ndifferent EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD',\n",

       " 'and typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa-\\ntion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. In addition, we\\nsystematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa-\\ntion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an\\nalternative preferred item).',\n",
       " 'To address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching\\nopportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders,\\n2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of\\nnovel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve,\\nBrothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children\\nwith ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial\\nfacilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel\\nevent on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?”',\n",
       " 'Different topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g.,\\n“Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that\\nmanding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being\\ngeneralized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we\\nspeculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would\\nbe more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what\\ninformation to provide.',\n",
       " 'We programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed\\ngeneralization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. Main-\\ntenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion.

The purpose of the AO1 and\\nAO2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an EO and not\\nsomething about the experimental preparation. During AO1 trials, participants were\\nimmediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not\\nhave an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an\\nunusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants\\nwere not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is,\\nthey were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board,\\nwatched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in\\nthe environment, so there was no EO for manding “why?”',\n",

       " 'Baseline During all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the\\nexperimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items\\nand said “Which one do you want?” or “Pick one.” During AO1 trials in baseline, when\\nthe participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail-\\nability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item.\\nFor example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “Oh! You\\ncan’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said\\n“But you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. During AO2 trials in\\nbaseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to\\nthe item and said “Sure! You can have it.” During EO trials in baseline, when the item\\nwas selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “You\\ncan’t have it.”). If the participant manded “Why can’t I have it?” within 10 s, the\\nexperimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative,\\nrelated item as described previously.

Future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more\\nefficiently. For example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide\\ndifferent reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the\\nceiling). However, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular\\nscenario, the participant may not have an EO to mand “why?” in the future for the\\nsame/similar scenario. Additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant\\nto continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided.',\n",
       " 'To bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information\\nas the consequence for the mand.

In the restricted access condition, during EO and AO1 trials, although\\nparticipants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in\\nthe same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). In the emotional\\nresponding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the\\nnumber of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other\\nstudents, and to increase attending. We also thought pausing the video after showing\\nthe emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the\\nresponding would be particularly reinforcing. Finally, in the unusual events condition,\\nwe delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people\\nask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem.\\nClinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and\\nconsequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer\\ncontrol.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of having two AO conditions rather than just one as in previous studies\\n(e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under\\nthe control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. The two\\nAO conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced-\\nent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. During AO1 trials, participants\\nwere provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have\\nan item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual\\nevent) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were\\nimmediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response\\nor unusual scenario so there was no EO for manding “why?” We deemed this important\\nfor promoting EO control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. Future\\nstudies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. A second function of the AO2\\ntrials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access\\ncondition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific\\nitems they manded for. That is, without AO2 trials, manding would have always\\nresulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only\\nhave alternative items. This would not have resembled the natural environment and\\ncould have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time.',\n",

Although previous studies have\\nevaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies\\nhave demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of\\nthe present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant\\nestablishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem-\\nplar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa-\\ntion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios\\nwithin a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to\\nnovel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time. Social validity for the\\nintervention had an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7).\\n\\nKeywords Mand . Information . Trial-unique . Why\\n\\nTypically developing children are often proficient with many mands for information by\\npreschool (Rowland & Pine, 2000; Sundberg, Loeb, Hale, & Eigenheer, 2002). The\\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) asserts that typically devel-\\noping children ask “why?” between 2 and 3 years of age and ask “when?” and “how?”\\nbetween 4 and 5 years (ASHA, n.d.). Rowland, Pine, Lieven, and Theakston (2003)\\n\\nThis study is based on a thesis submitted by the first author, under the supervision of the second author, to the\\nDepartment of Applied Behavior Analysis at Caldwell University for the Master of Arts in Applied Behavior\\nAnalysis.\\n\\n* Tina M.

To address this issue when teaching other mands for information,\\nmost studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in\\naccess to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011),\\nmanding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to\\nsubsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred\\nactivity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?”\\nresulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It\\nmay be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning\\nthe reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For\\nexample, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in\\nthe middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is\\ninformation (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity.\\n\\nSecond, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand\\n“how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring\\nthat an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason\\nfor something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs\\nfor the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present.\\nFor example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the\\nreason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that\\ninformation as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse-\\nquence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach\\nthe mand “why?”\\n\\nDespite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?”\\nresearchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of\\nskill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the\\nenvironment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and\\nexpand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore,\\nthe purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand\\n“why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described\\npreviously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three\\ndifferent EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n3\\n\\nand typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa-\\ntion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. In addition, we\\nsystematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa-\\ntion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an\\nalternative preferred item).\\n\\nTo address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching\\nopportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders,\\n2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of\\nnovel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve,\\nBrothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children\\nwith ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial\\nfacilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel\\nevent on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?”\\n\\nDifferent topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g.,\\n“Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that\\nmanding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being\\ngeneralized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we\\nspeculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would\\nbe more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what\\ninformation to provide.\\n\\nWe programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed\\ngeneralization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. Main-\\ntenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion. Finally,\\nBoard Certified Behavior Analysts and special education teachers were asked to assess\\nthe social validity of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study.\\n\\nMethod\\n\\nParticipants and Setting\\n\\nThe participants were three children who had been previously diagnosed with ASD:\\nGianna (9 years, 11 months), Brandon (18 years, 4 months), and Ken (8 years, 1 month).\\nAll participants attended educational programs that provided comprehensive behavior-\\nanalytic instruction. They all demonstrated mastery of manding for preferred items,\\nmanding “where?”, imitating a question/phrase with at least five syllables, initiating joint\\nattention with at least one type of response for two scenarios, and waiting 60 s for a\\npreferred item when presented with the instruction “Wait.” Caregivers and instructors\\nreported that the participants had not learned to mand “why?” and that this was an\\nimportant skill for them to learn. Sessions were conducted in a room in a university-\\nbased autism center or in the participant’s home during teaching trials and in other settings\\nin the participant’s natural environment (e.g., outside, library) during generalization probes.\\n\\nPreexperimental Assessments\\n\\nPreference assessment A questionnaire based on the Reinforcer Assessment for Indi-\\nviduals With Severe Disabilities (Fisher, Piazza, Bowman, & Amari, 1996) was\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nadministered to parents and teachers of each participant before the study to identify\\npreferred items. The 12 highest ranked items were selected from a paired-stimulus\\npreference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992). Teachers were also asked to identify an\\nadditional 12 items that were similar to the high-preference items (i.e., in the same\\ncategory) to be used as alternative items during EO trials of the restricted access\\nscenario. Access to all high-preference items was restricted to experimental sessions\\nonly.\\n\\nSkills assessments Four skills assessments were conducted to ensure participants\\ndemonstrated the skills necessary for inclusion in the study: repeating questions from\\na voice recorder, initiating joint attention, tacting emotions, and choosing preferred\\nitems from a pictorial choice board. All participants responded correctly and indepen-\\ndently during all the following assessments such that no further teaching was required.\\nThe voice-recorder assessment evaluated whether the participants vocally imitated\\nthree questions played on a voice recorder to ensure the prerecorded prompt used in the\\nstudy would evoke echoic responding (Somers et al., 2014). The questions used in this\\nassessment had four, five, and six syllables (as the models in the study) but did not\\nshare any of the same words as the models in the study. The experimenter stood 0.5 m\\nfrom the participant and played the recorded question for the participant to repeat. A\\ncorrect response was defined as the participant emitting the complete question correctly\\nand independently within 5 s.\\n\\nThe joint attention assessment was used to evaluate whether participants initiated\\nbids for joint attention, as this was a necessary skill for the observation of the unusual\\nevents scenario. A correct response was defined as the participant engaging in at least\\none of these responses within 3 min of an unusual event being encountered as the\\nparticipant walked through the hallway or outside: pointing to or touching the unusual\\nitem, manding for attention (e.g., “Look!”), looking at the object and then at the\\nexperimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”).\\n\\nThe tact assessment was used to evaluate whether the participants could tact\\nemotions from facial expressions. The experimenter showed 14 photographs of two\\ndifferent people demonstrating seven different facial expressions (used during the\\nstudy) and asked the participant “What is she/he doing?” A correct response was\\ndefined as the participant tacting the emotion correctly and independently within 5 s\\nof the photograph being presented.\\n\\nThe choice-board assessment evaluated whether the participants could make choices\\nfor preferred items from photographs on a choice board. The experimenter presented a\\nchoice board with an array of 12 photographs of items identified in the preference\\nassessment and asked, “What do you want?” A correct response was defined as the\\nparticipant selecting a picture from the choice board and giving it to the experimenter\\nwithin 5 s (or pointing to a picture and vocally manding for it within 5 s), selecting the\\ncorresponding item from a box, and engaging with the item.\\n\\nMaterials, Scenarios, and Scripts\\n\\nTo identify scenarios likely to function as EOs for information about why something\\nhappened, we observed a classroom of 10 preschoolers who ranged from 2.5 to 4 years\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n5\\n\\nold. The observation was conducted over 2 days, and each observation period lasted for\\n3 hr. The experimenter sat at the back of a classroom and observed the preschool\\nstudents without interacting. Results showed that the most common antecedents to\\nasking “why?” were seeing other children engaging in emotional responding (e.g.,\\ncrying), and being denied access to preferred items and activities. Because of this,\\nrestricted access to preferred items and observation of emotional responses were\\nselected as two of the scenarios to use in the current study for teaching the mand\\n“why?” We also included a third scenario, unusual events, because the participants had\\ndemonstrated bids for joint attention to unusual events in the past.\\n\\nFor the restricted access condition, 24 preferred items were used for each participant.\\nFor the unusual events condition, 60 different scenarios were used that were deemed to\\nbe salient and not likely to occur in the setting in which sessions were conducted (see\\nTable 1 for examples). For the emotional responses condition, 48 videos depicting\\nseven emotional responses and different reasons with four different people (i.e., each\\nperson recorded 12 videos; see Table 2 for examples) and 28 videos depicting routine\\nactions/activities were used. Emotional responses were those that all participants could\\ntact and were age appropriate. A voice recorder was used to provide echoic prompts.\\nThe scripts used were recorded with a peer of the same gender to provide a socially\\nvalid model, and an iPad was used to record all sessions for subsequent data collection.\\nDuring the restricted access condition, a 30 cm × 35 cm laminated board, affixed with\\nVelcro with 12 photographs of items on one side and three photographs of items used\\nfor generalization probe trials on the other side, was used as a choice board. A laptop\\ncomputer was used to show videos during the emotional responses condition.\\n\\nExperimental Design and Data Collection\\n\\nA concurrent multiple-baseline design across three scenario types (i.e., restricted access\\nto preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events) was used to demonstrate\\nthe effects of the intervention with each participant. The order of scenario types was\\ncounterbalanced across participants (i.e., Gianna: restricted access, emotional re-\\nsponses, unusual scenarios; Brandon: emotional responses, unusual scenarios, restricted\\naccess; Ken: unusual scenarios, restricted access, emotional responses). During each\\ntrial, the participant’s response was scored as correct or incorrect. A correct response\\nduring EO trials was defined as the participant independently saying the full mand for\\ninformation (i.e., “Why is that there?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why can’t I have\\nit?”) within 10 s of the unavailability statement, end of the video, or the participant\\nindicating the unusual event. Equivalent mands (e.g., “Why is she laughing?”) were\\nalso scored as correct. Indicating an unusual event was defined as the participant\\npointing to it or touching it, manding for attention to it (e.g., “Look.”), looking at it\\nand then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). AO1\\n(Abolishing Operation 1) trials, in which the information/reason was immediately\\nprovided, and AO2 trials, in which the participants were not exposed to restricted\\naccess, emotional responding, or unusual events, were scored as incorrect if the\\nparticipant said “why” at any point during the trial. Data were summarized and graphed\\nas the percentage of independent correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2\\ntrials, generalization EO trials, generalization AO1 trials, and generalization AO2 trials\\nper session.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nTable 1 Examples of Unusual Scenarios\\n\\nType\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nScenario\\n\\nReason\\n\\nAction\\n\\nPitcher of water on desk\\n\\nThis was left over from watering the\\n\\nLet’s go dump it out.\\n\\nEmoji pillows on floor\\n\\nSomeone forgot these.\\n\\nplants.\\n\\nClothes scattered on\\n\\nbathroom floor\\n\\nThe bin must have tipped over.\\n\\nCotton balls in lunch bag\\n\\nThis says “Sharon.”\\n\\nLet’s give them to\\n\\nDebbie.\\n\\nLet’s put them back.\\n\\nLet’s go put it in\\nSharon’s office.\\n\\nWater bottles on computer\\n\\nThese are for all your teachers.\\n\\nWant to help give them\\n\\nchair\\n\\nPlay\\n\\nStar Wars figurines in\\n\\nChris was playing with them.\\n\\nhallway\\n\\nout?\\n\\nLet’s get Chris to play\\n\\nwith us!\\n\\nGlitter bottles on table\\n\\nSomeone was making a card.\\n\\nWant to play with\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nonly\\n\\nAlec left it for us.\\n\\nGlobe on desk\\nPom-poms scattered on floor Tasha was playing snowball fight.\\nRed car with remote on desk Clem was playing with it.\\nBirds hanging from the door Gemma was playing zoo.\\nA picnic set up on sidewalk Someone’s going to have a picnic.\\nI think someone is cleaning out the\\nUtensils spread all over\\n\\nkitchen counter\\n\\nkitchen cabinets.\\n\\nthem?\\n\\nWant to see it?\\nLet’s play!\\nWant to try it?\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\nDebbie’s chair upside down Debbie must be fixing her chair.\\nFlowers in big bag on\\n\\nLaney was pretending it’s a flower\\n\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\nkitchen floor\\n\\nstore.\\n\\nTable 2 Examples of Emotional Responses\\n\\nEmotion He/she’s [emotion] because …\\n\\nHappy\\nTired\\nHurt\\nSad\\n\\nShe’s eating candy.\\nShe’s doing a lot of exercises.\\nThe door shut on his finger.

Each session\\nconsisted of 12 trials: five EO trials, two AO1 trials, two AO2 trials, and generalization\\nprobe trials for EO, AO1, and AO2. Trials were quasi-randomly ordered every session,\\nwith no more than two EO trials in a row. The purpose of EO trials was to contrive an\\nEO to teach the mand “why?” for the particular condition. The purpose of the AO1 and\\nAO2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an EO and not\\nsomething about the experimental preparation. During AO1 trials, participants were\\nimmediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not\\nhave an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an\\nunusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants\\nwere not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is,\\nthey were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board,\\nwatched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in\\nthe environment, so there was no EO for manding “why?”\\n\\nA trial-unique procedure was used for all three scenarios to maintain the value of\\ninformation for the mand “why?” Within each scenario, relevant features such as\\npreferred items, unavailability statements, reasons, and alternative items (restricted\\naccess scenario); emotional responses, people, and reasons (emotional responses sce-\\nnario); and unusual events, reasons, and related actions (unusual events scenario) were\\ncounterbalanced across trials and trial types so that manding would not come under the\\ncontrol of any specific features or combination of features.\\n\\nBaseline During all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the\\nexperimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items\\nand said “Which one do you want?” or “Pick one.” During AO1 trials in baseline, when\\nthe participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail-\\nability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item.\\nFor example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “Oh! You\\ncan’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said\\n“But you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. During AO2 trials in\\nbaseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to\\nthe item and said “Sure! You can have it.” During EO trials in baseline, when the item\\nwas selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “You\\ncan’t have it.”). If the participant manded “Why can’t I have it?” within 10 s, the\\nexperimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative,\\nrelated item as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within\\n10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next” and put\\nthe items away.\\n\\nDuring all trials in baseline sessions of the emotional responses scenario, the\\nexperimenter showed a video of someone engaging in an emotional response. During\\nAO1 trials in baseline, 10 s after the video ended, the experimenter provided a reason\\nusing a tone and facial expression that matched the emotion and played the next part of\\nthe video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, if a\\nparticipant watched a video of a girl laughing, the experimenter paused the video and\\nsaid “She’s laughing because someone tickled her!” and played the next part of the\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nvideo that showed someone tickling the girl. During AO2 trials in baseline, a video of\\nsomeone engaging in a routine action with a neutral expression was shown to the\\nparticipant. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant manded “Why is he/she\\ndoing that?” within 10 s of the video ending, the experimenter provided the reason as\\ndescribed previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the\\nexperimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.”\\n\\nDuring all trials of baseline sessions of the unusual events scenario, the experimenter\\nwalked with the participant to a different room or hallway or outside. During AO1 trials\\nin baseline, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter\\nprovided a reason for it being there and an action related to it. For example, if a\\nparticipant opened his or her backpack and found a pillow, the experimenter said “This\\nsays ‘Meghan’—Meghan must have left this here—let’s go put it in her office” and\\nwalked with the participant to Meghan’s office to put it there. During AO2 trials in\\nbaseline, there was nothing unusual in the environment. For example, when a participant\\nwalked into the classroom and there was nothing unusual, the participant continued with\\nhis or her daily schedule. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant correctly\\nmanded “Why is that there?” within 10 s, the experimenter immediately provided a\\nreason and continued as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly\\nwithin 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.”\\n\\nMand training Training sessions were identical to baseline sessions with the following\\nexceptions. During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, when the participant\\nselected the item, the experimenter immediately provided an unavailability statement\\nand played the recorded prompt “Why can’t I have it?” out of the participant’s view.\\nAfter the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately\\nprovided an appropriate reason and offered an alternative item in a similar category.\\nDuring EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, 10 s after the participant watched\\nthe video, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is he/she doing that?”\\nout of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the\\nexperimenter immediately provided the reason and played the next part of the video\\nthat showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, after the participant\\nwatched the first part of the video, which showed a boy hurt (i.e., saying “Ouch!”), and\\nsuccessfully echoed the recorded prompt, the experimenter immediately said “He’s hurt\\nbecause the door shut on his finger!” and played the second part of the video showing\\nthe reason the boy was hurt (i.e., his finger getting caught in the door). During EO trials\\nof the unusual events scenario, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual\\nevent, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is that there?” out of the\\nparticipant’s view. After the participant engaged in the echoic, the experimenter\\nimmediately provided an appropriate reason and then suggested (a) helping to fix the\\nsituation, (b) playing with the item, or (c) nothing else.\\n\\nAfter meeting criterion during the full-script condition (i.e., 100% correct responding\\nwith or without scripts for two consecutive sessions), a baseline (no-script) probe was\\nconducted to test for independent manding. If a participant responded at 100% accuracy\\nfor two consecutive sessions independently, the skill was considered mastered.\\n\\nGeneralization To assess generalization, three generalization trials were conducted\\nunder baseline conditions during each session. These trials were conducted by novel\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n9\\n\\ninstructors or caregivers (i.e., familiar to the participant but not involved in the study) in\\nnovel settings (e.g., outside, on a walk, in the library). During EO trials of the restricted\\naccess scenario, we used a different colored choice board with photographs of three\\nitems that were not identified via the preference assessment but were nominated by\\nteachers/caregivers as items that were manded for on a daily basis. During EO trials of\\nthe emotional responses scenario, a novel instructor acted out emotional responses\\nin vivo. During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, novel unusual events occurred.\\nFor all AO1 and AO2 trials during generalization for all three scenarios, procedures\\nsimilar to baseline were followed.\\n\\nMaintenance Maintenance probes were conducted 1 week after a participant reached\\nthe mastery criterion, and followed the same procedures as baseline. Instructors/\\ncaregivers were asked to provide two opportunities to mand for each scenario for the\\nEO condition and two opportunities for the AO1 and AO2 conditions each day between\\nthe conclusion of the study and the maintenance probe.\\n\\nInterobserver Agreement and Procedural Integrity\\n\\nInterobserver agreement (IOA) data were collected for 50% of baseline sessions,\\nintervention sessions, and maintenance sessions. An agreement was defined as both\\nobservers recording a trial as correct or incorrect. IOA was calculated using point-by-\\npoint agreement by dividing the number of agreements over the total number of\\nagreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100%. IOA was 100% for all three\\nparticipants.\\n\\nProcedural integrity data were taken during 50% of all baseline, intervention, and\\nmaintenance sessions for all three participants by secondary observers via video\\nrecordings. A trial was scored as correct if all of the following were correct: statements,\\nprompts, consequences, materials, and timing. Procedural integrity data were calculated\\nby dividing the total number of correct trials over the total number of correct and\\nincorrect trials and multiplying by 100%. Mean procedural integrity was 98% (range\\n97%–100%) for Brandon and 100% for Gianna and Ken.\\n\\nSocial Validity\\n\\nThree special education teachers and two Board Certified Behavior Analysts were\\ngiven brief descriptions of the procedures and shown videos of each condition. They\\ncompleted a modified Treatment Acceptability Rating Form–Revised (TARF-R;\\nReimers & Wacker, 1988), which uses a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = disagree\\nstrongly; 7 = agree strongly).\\n\\nResults\\n\\nData on the percentage of correct responses for all participants are presented in Figs. 1\\nthrough 3. As can be seen in Fig. 1, during baseline Gianna responded correctly during\\nAO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nin the restricted access to preferred items condition (top panel), Gianna reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. Although she did not ask “why?”\\nduring two EO trials (Sessions 13 and 15), asked “where’s [item]?” during one AO1\\ntrial (Session 14), and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 15), no procedural\\nmodifications were needed. When the script was removed, she met the mastery\\ncriterion in two sessions. During mand training in the emotional responses condition\\n(middle panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions.\\nWhen the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in three sessions. During\\nmand training in the unusual events condition (bottom panel), Gianna reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script and with the script removed in two sessions each.\\nAs can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, during baseline of the emotional responses\\ncondition, Brandon responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand\\n“why?” during EO trials. He did not ask “why?” during five EO trials (Sessions 11 and 17)\\nand asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 17). He reached the mastery criterion\\nwith the full script in five sessions and with the script removed in three sessions. A similar\\npattern was observed in the unusual events condition (middle panel): He reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script in four sessions and with the script removed in two\\nsessions. A different pattern was observed during the restricted access condition. Although\\nhis caregivers reported that he had not previously learned to mand “why?” and he did not\\nmand “why?” during baseline of the other conditions, during the first four sessions of\\nbaseline of the restricted access condition (bottom panel), Brandon manded “why not?”\\n“how come?” and “why can’t I have [item]?” during 50% of EO trials. However, he also\\nmade errors during 50% of EO trials, 50% of AO1 trials, and 100% of EO generalization\\ntrials of those sessions (i.e., for the AO1 trials, Brandon manded “why?” even when the\\ninstructor provided a reason, and for the EO trials and the EO generalization trials,\\nBrandon did not mand “why?”). After reaching the mastery criterion in the emotional\\nresponses condition (i.e., top panel), he subsequently scored 100% during all trials of the\\nnext four sessions in the restricted access condition without teaching.\\n\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, during baseline Ken responded correctly during AO1 and\\nAO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training in the\\nunusual events condition (top panel), he reached the mastery criterion for the full-script\\ncondition in five sessions and for the no-script condition in four sessions. During this\\nscenario, Ken asked “why?” during two AO1 trials (Sessions 10 and 17). During mand\\ntraining in the restricted access condition (middle panel), Ken reached the mastery\\ncriterion for the full-script condition in three sessions and for the no-script condition in\\ntwo sessions. Similarly, in the emotional responses condition, he reached the mastery\\ncriterion for both the full-script and no-script conditions in two sessions each.\\n\\nAs with acquisition, all participants demonstrated generalized manding quickly. Only one\\nparticipant, Ken, made an error during a generalization trial of the no-script condition. During\\nSession 18, during the AO1 trial, after the experimenter provided the reason for the unusual\\nevent, Ken asked “Where should the star bucket go?” Interestingly, during the full-script\\ncondition of the emotional responses condition, Gianna initially engaged in errors during\\ngeneralization EO trials and generalization AO1 trials and responded with laughter and\\nstereotypy (e.g., when the novel instructor acted out the scenario for surprise, Gianna started\\nlaughing and talking about a cartoon video clip). Subsequently, a procedural modification\\nwas made during Sessions 23, 24, and 25 to temporarily make the generalization conditions\\n(i.e., in vivo presentation of emotional responding) more like the teaching conditions (i.e.,\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n11\\n\\nBaseline                          Full Script\\n\\nNo Script                        Maintenance\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\n0\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\ns\\ne\\ns\\nn\\no\\np\\ns\\ne\\nR\\n\\n \\nt\\nc\\ne\\nr\\nr\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\nt\\nn\\ne\\nd\\nn\\ne\\np\\ne\\nd\\nn\\nI\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nw\\n \\ns\\nl\\na\\ni\\nr\\nT\\n \\nf\\no\\n\\n \\ne\\ng\\na\\nt\\nn\\ne\\nc\\nr\\ne\\nP\\n\\nRestricted Access\\n\\nEmotional Responses\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n6\\n\\nEO\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n21\\n\\nSessions\\n\\n26\\n\\n31\\n\\n36\\n\\n41\\n\\nAO2\\n\\nGen EO\\n\\nGen AO1\\n\\nGen AO2\\n\\nAO1\\n\\nUnusual Scenarios\\n\\nFig. 1 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes\\nacross each scenario for Gianna\\n\\nvideo presentation of emotional responding).

This might contribute\\nto a more thorough understanding of the functions of these mands and how we might\\nteach them more effectively and efficiently to children with ASD. Finally, clinicians\\nmight take advantage of EOs specific to their clients to teach this mand. For example,\\nsome children with ASD who experience changes in their routine as particularly\\naversive may have a strong EO for learning about reasons for those changes.\\n\\nTrial-unique multiple-exemplar training was used to promote accurate stimulus/EO\\ncontrol and generalization. First, in the restricted access condition, 12 preferred items and a\\nminimum of three unavailability statements were used. Second, in the emotional responses\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\ncondition, four different peers and seven different emotions were used. Third, in the\\nunusual events condition, four different locations and 60 different events were used.\\nAlthough this required much planning and time, this cost may be deemed worth the\\nbenefit of rapid acquisition, generalization, maintenance, and accurate EO control of this\\nmand. Future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more\\nefficiently. For example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide\\ndifferent reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the\\nceiling). However, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular\\nscenario, the participant may not have an EO to mand “why?” in the future for the\\nsame/similar scenario. Additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant\\nto continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided.\\n\\nTo bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information\\nas the consequence for the mand. However, we speculated that we might be able to\\nenhance the value of the consequences we provided; we did this in different ways in\\neach condition. In the restricted access condition, during EO and AO1 trials, although\\nparticipants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in\\nthe same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). In the emotional\\nresponding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the\\nnumber of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other\\nstudents, and to increase attending. We also thought pausing the video after showing\\nthe emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the\\nresponding would be particularly reinforcing. Finally, in the unusual events condition,\\nwe delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people\\nask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem.\\nClinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and\\nconsequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer\\ncontrol.\\n\\nThe purpose of having two AO conditions rather than just one as in previous studies\\n(e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under\\nthe control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. The two\\nAO conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced-\\nent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. During AO1 trials, participants\\nwere provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have\\nan item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual\\nevent) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were\\nimmediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response\\nor unusual scenario so there was no EO for manding “why?” We deemed this important\\nfor promoting EO control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. Future\\nstudies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. A second function of the AO2\\ntrials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access\\ncondition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific\\nitems they manded for. That is, without AO2 trials, manding would have always\\nresulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only\\nhave alternative items. This would not have resembled the natural environment and\\ncould have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time.\\n\\nA voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts. All participants mastered the\\nmand “why?” after the full-script condition, and it was unnecessary to use the partial-\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n15\\n\\nscript condition for any of the participants. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic\\nprompts, rather than in vivo vocal models, as it has been suggested that the former may\\nbe easier to fade (Howlett et al., 2011). Future studies might compare the effectiveness,\\nefficiency, and social validity of these types of prompts. It should be noted that all\\nparticipants in the current study had prior exposure to prompts via voice recorders and\\nto choice boards and also displayed specific skills relevant to the scenarios (i.e., joint\\nattention, tacting emotional responses). Clinicians should assess necessary prerequisite\\nskills for potential learners, as it may help with faster and efficient skill acquisition and\\nalso help with effective prompts and prompt-fading strategies.\\n\\nFor all participants, manding “why?” maintained 1 week after mastery. During the\\nweek between mastery and the maintenance probe, teachers provided at least two\\nopportunities to practice manding “why?” each day to assist with maintenance over\\ntime. Successful maintenance may have resulted from teaching during the study and/or\\npracticing during the week.\\n\\nSocial validity was assessed via a modified version of the TARF-R (Reimers &\\nWacker, 1988) and indicated that the procedures used in this study were time consum-\\ning for the experimenter but acceptable to achieve the desired results. Although the\\nprocedures for the current study were complex, all participants acquired the mand\\n“why?” in all three scenarios and also maintained the skill after 1 week. The total\\nnumber of sessions for all three participants did not exceed 21 sessions.\\n\\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\\n\\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\\n\\nEthical approval All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance\\nwith the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki\\ndeclaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\\n\\nInformed consent\\n\\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

This paper argues that Allen's proof is not correct when schedules are presented in pairs and that his initial assumptions are too restrictive when all schedules are simultaneously available. (Score: 0.6605)\n",
      "The matching law may be viewed either as an empirical generalization, and therby subject to disproof, or as part of a system of equations used to define the utility (“value”) of a reinforcer. In the latter case it is tautologous, and not subject to disproof within the defining context. A failure to obtain matching will most often be a signal that the independent variables have not been properly scaled. If, however, the proper transformations have been made on the independent variables, and matching is not obtained, the experimental paradigm may be outside the purview of the matching law. At that point, reinterpretations or revisions of the law are called for. The theoretical matching law is but one of many possible ways to define utility, and it may eventually be rejected in favor of a more useful definition. (Score: 0.6527)\n",
      "Herrnstein's matching theory requires the parameter, k, which appears in the single-alternative form of the matching equation, to remain invariant with respect to changes in reinforcement parameters like magnitude or immediacy. Recent experiments have disconfirmed matching theory by showing that the invariant-k requirement does not hold. However, the theory can be asserted in a purely algebraic form that does not require an invariant k and that is not disconfirmed by the recent findings. In addition, both the original and the purely algebraic versions of matching theory can be asserted in forms that allow for commonly observed deviations from matching (bias, undermatching, and overmatching). The recent finding of a variable k does not disconfirm these versions of matching theory either. As a consequence, matching remains a viable theory of behavior, the strength of which lies in its general conceptualization of all behavior as choice, and in its unified mathematical treatment of single- and multialternative environments. (Score: 0.6419)\n",
      "The matching law implies that any form of behavior approaches an asymptotic frequency as its reinforcement approaches 100 per cent of the total reinforcement being obtained at a given time. This asymptote is formally independent of the kind or quantity of drive or reinforcement associated with the response in question or with any competing response. (Score: 0.6391)\n",
      "Classic matching theory, which is based on Herrnstein's (1961) original matching equation and includes the well-known quantitative law of effect, is almost certainly false. The theory is logically inconsistent with known experimental findings, and experiments have shown that its central constant-k assumption is not tenable. Modern matching theory, which is based on the power function version of the original matching equation, remains tenable, although it has not been discussed or studied extensively. The modern theory is logically consistent with known experimental findings, it predicts the fact and details of the violation of the classic theory's constant-k assumption, and it accurately describes at least some data that are inconsistent with the classic theory.

       "'A within-subject design, using human participants, compared delay discounting functions for real and hypothetical money rewards. Both real and hypothetical rewards were studied across a range that included $10 to $250. For 5 of the 6 participants, no systematic difference in discount rate was observed in response to real and hypothetical choices, suggesting that hypothetical rewards may often serve as a valid proxy for real rewards in delay discounting research. By measuring discounting at an unprecedented range of real rewards, this study has also systematically replicated the robust finding in human delay discounting research that discount rates decrease with increasing magnitude of reward. A hyperbolic decay model described the data better than an exponential model.'"
