       "'JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR 2010, 94, 159–160 NUMBER 2 (SEPTEMBER) EDITORIAL: CHOICE STUDIES IN TRANSITION _______________________________________________________________________________ Almost half a century ago, in this very journal, Richard Herrnstein (1961) published his seminal paper ‘‘Relative and absolute strength of response as a function of frequency of reinforcement.’’ Herrnstein showed that in the steady state the proportion of responding on a schedule was equal to the proportion of reinforcement obtained on that schedule: the matching law. Besides introducing to researchers one of the great quantitative regularities in psychology, this influential paper put front and center the topic of choice in behavior analysis. It also set the terms under which choice would be studied for the next 40 years: steady state behavior, and molar variables. In his paper, Herrnstein was concerned with the asymptotic behavior that emerges after an organism has been exposed to the same schedule conditions for a period of several days, not by the way the moment-to-moment interaction between the organism and its environment lead to those asymptotic performances. The contingencies of reinforcement to which the pigeons were exposed were stable, both in the sense that they prevailed over long periods of time and in the sense that, given the feedback function in concurrent variable-interval (VI) schedules, the experienced reinforcement rate ratio was relatively independent of the animal’s response distribution. it changes launched. Part of With few exceptions (e.g., Shimp, 1966; Staddon, Hinson, & Kram, 1981), these features of Herrnstein’s paper have dominated the booming field of operant choice behavior that the reason is technical: before digital technology became commonplace, the only convenient method of recording moment-by-moment in behavior was Skinner’s cumulative recorder. But the molar approach was also favored because for many years it succeeded. Many new relations were found, many intriguing puzzles solved. But as technology improved, a more moleclevel of analysis ular, moment-by-moment doi: 10.1901/jeab.2010.94-159 began to gain traction: Research appeared that looked at the effect of individual reinforcers on choice performance (e.g., Aparicio & Baum, 2009; Davison & Baum, 2000; Corrado, Sugrue, Seung, & Newsome, 2005; Lau & Glimcher, 2005), that tried to characterize behavior in transition before it reached its asymptotic state (i.e., Banna & Newland, 2009; Bailey & Mazur, 1990; Cerutti & Staddon, 2004; Gallistel, Mark, King, & Latham, 2001), or that studied behavior in unstable environments, due either to frequent changes in the contingencies of reinforcement (i.e., Davison & Baum, 2000; Grace & McLean, 2006) or to the schedule’s feedback function (i.e., Palya & Allan, 2003). These are topics that also will be addressed by the seven articles in this Special Section. Baum’s paper provides an overview of his previous research with Michael Davison on the effect of individual reinforcers on choice in unstable environments, casting it in a more general framework, which tries to reconcile a molar approach with the study of the dynamics of choice, while Rodewald, Hughes, and Pitts revisit them in their contribution. In their paper, Davison, Marr, and Elliffe explore complex feedback functions where the behavior of the animal has a major impact on the experienced reinforcement rate. Kyonka and Grace’s contribution continues the exploration by Randy Grace and his colleagues (e.g., Grace & McLean, 2006) of concurrent chain schedules where the fixed-interval (FI) terminal links vary randomly from session to session. The paper by Christensen and Grace provides a theoretical framework for conceptualizing those results. McDowell and Popa show how molar regularities such as the matching law could emerge from the local action of a selection-by-reinforcement And Staddon, MacPhail, and Padilla provide another example of simple dynamical modeling. principle. The study of the dynamics of choice is very recent in behavior analysis. Hence, the basic facts are not yet fully established. There is no agreement yet about models. Even the questions that should be addressed by researchers 159 \\x0c160 EDITORIAL are far from settled. Many laboratories have been following their own line, with little effort to integrate their efforts with the work of others. Perhaps this is to be expected in a stillyoung field. We hope that this issue of JEAB, by bringing together contributions from different perspectives on the dynamics of operant behavior, will help stimulate more research and encourage a more integrative approach to this important topic.

VOLKERT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY DOROTHEA C. LERMAN UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON, CLEAR LAKE AND NICOLE TROSCLAIR, LAURA ADDISON, AND TIFFANY KODAK LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY Research has demonstrated that interspersing mastered tasks with new tasks facilitates learning under certain conditions; however, little is known about factors that influence the effectiveness of this treatment strategy. The initial purpose of the current investigation was to evaluate the effects of similar versus dissimilar interspersed tasks while teaching object labels to children diagnosed with autism or developmental delays. We then conducted a series of exploratory analyses involving the type of reinforcer delivered for correct responses on trials with unknown or known object labels. Performance was enhanced under the interspersal condition only when either brief praise was delivered for all correct responses or presumably more preferred reinforcers were provided for performance on known trials rather than on unknown trials. DESCRIPTORS: autism, behavioral momentum, high-probability instructional sequence, interspersal procedures, reinforcer potency _______________________________________________________________________________ The results of previous research have suggested that interspersing mastered tasks with new or unknown tasks facilitates learning of the new tasks (e.g., Browder & Shear, 1996; Dunlap, 1984; Neef, Iwata, & Page, 1977, 1980; Rowan & Pear, 1985). For example, Dunlap compared the acquisition of skills (e.g., spelling, placing action sequence cards in order) across three conditions with 5 children who had been diagnosed with autism. All children acquired the skills in fewer trials during the condition in which mastered tasks were interspersed with new tasks. Research also has suggested that interspersing instructions associated with a high probability of compliance (high p) with instructions associated with a lower probability of compliance (low p) results in increased compliance with low-p instrucAddress correspondence to Valerie Volkert, 900 Farnam St. Apt. 813, Omaha, Nebraska 68102 (e-mail: vvolkert@ unmc.edu). doi: 10.1901/jaba.2008.41-335 tions, a procedure that has been referred to as behavioral momentum (Mace et al., 1988; Nevin, Mandel, & Atak, 1983). Mace et al. presented a series of high-p instructions immediately before a low-p instruction to adults with mental retardation who had a history of noncompliance. Compliance with the low-p requests increased under this intervention. Even though the results of a number of studies have demonstrated that interspersal and the high-p instructional sequence may be effective (e.g., Chong & Carr, 2005; Mace et al., 1988; Neef et al., 1977, 1980; Patel et al., 2006; Rowan & Pear, 1985), the results of other studies have indicated that the interspersal procedure and high-p instructional sequences may not always improve performance (e.g., Charlop, Kurtz, & Milstein, 1992; Zarcone, Iwata, Hughes, & Vollmer, 1993). For example, in Charlop et al., 5 children with autism initially failed to acquire simple responses when instructed with a task-interspersal procedure. 335 '336 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. During the baseline condition, correct performance on unknown tasks produced praise and food reinforcers on a fixed-ratio 1 schedule. Correct responses on mastered tasks produced praise on a fixed-ratio 1 schedule and food reinforcers on a variable-ratio 3 schedule. The authors hypothesized that the dense schedule of reinforcement for the mastered tasks hindered acquisition of the unknown tasks. Thus, in subsequent conditions, correct responses on the mastered tasks produced either no reinforcement or praise only, whereas correct responses on the unknown tasks continued to be reinforced with praise and food reinforcers. The responses associated with the unknown tasks were acquired only when participants did not receive food reinforcers for correct responding on the mastered tasks, thus raising the question of whether the quality of reinforcement for mastered tasks affected the acquisition of the unknown tasks. Mace, Mauro, Boyajian, and Eckert (1997) examined the extent to which the quality of the reinforcer provided for compliance to high-p requests (food rather than praise, presumably a lower quality reinforcer) influenced compliance to low-p requests, which was reinforced with praise throughout the study. For both participants, compliance to low-p requests improved only when food reinforcement than praise was provided for compliance to high-p requests. rather for compliance reinforcer low-p tasks was not The results of studies on interspersal and the high-p instructional sequence raise a number of questions regarding the conditions under which in most these procedures are effective. First, studies, the to selected unknown or empirically and, in fact, was commonly praise (e.g., Dunlap & Koegel, 1980; Mace & Belfiore, 1990; Mace et al., 1988; Neef et al., 1977, 1980), which may or may not be a highquality reinforcer for children with developmental disabilities. Thus, additional research is needed to further clarify the role of the quality of the reinforcer for mastered tasks on the effects of task interspersal. technique was Second, the potentially important distinction between improving performance on mastered tasks and enhancing the acquisition of new skills has been largely overlooked. In some studies, the interspersal intended to promote acquisition of new skills (Charlop et al., 1992; Dunlap, 1984; Neef et al., 1980; Rowan & Pear, 1985). Other studies did not specify whether participants had previously that were targeted for acquired the skills improvement (Robinson & Skinner, 2002; Wildmon, Skinner, Watson, & Garrett, 2004). Most important, mastered and unknown tasks may not have been differentiated adequately in many of these studies (see Lerman et al., 2005, for a discussion). Third, in most studies on the interspersal technique, the targeted and interspersed tasks involved similar skills, materials, and instructions. For example, in Neef et al. (1980), words that the child could already spell correctly were interspersed with new spelling words, and in Patel et al. (2006), one presentation of food on a spoon was preceded by three presentations of water on a spoon to increase food acceptance by 1 participant. Research has not yet investigated whether the type of interspersed task contributes to the success of the interspersal procedure. Finally, the interspersal technique is often recommended for use with children with autism, yet many studies on interspersal have been conducted with children of typical development or those with learning disabilities (e.g., Cooke, Guzaukas, Pressley, & Kerr, 1993; Cooke & Reichard, 1996; Logan & Skinner, 1998; Roberts & Shapiro, 1996; Robinson & Skinner, 2002; Wildmon et al., 2004). The purpose of Experiment 1 was to examine the benefits of the interspersal technique when (a) food reinforcers were selected on the basis of a systematic preference assessment, (b) interspersed maintenance tasks involved similar versus dissimilar materials and instructions 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 337 relative to the unknown task, and (c) more reinforcement was provided for correct responses on the unknown tasks than for correct responses on the known tasks (Charlop et al., 1992). After no clear benefits of the interspersal technique were found, it was hypothesized that reinforcer quality may influence the effectiveness of the interspersal procedure. Therefore, several exploratory analyses of this hypothesis were conducted in Experiment 2 to evaluate the extent to which the quality of the reinforcer (e.g., praise vs. preferred food reinforcers) provided for correct unknown or known responses influenced the effectiveness of the interspersal technique. GENERAL METHOD Participants and Setting Five children who had been diagnosed with autism (Jack, Luke, Bobby, and Paul) or developmental and language delays (Sal) participated in the study. Paul had also been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. All of the children reportedly engaged in problem behavior or noncompliance during instruction. Results of functional assessments conducted separately from this study indicated that problem behavior was at least partly maintained by escape from demands. Prior to this study, all of the participants had been exposed to treatment with escape extinction, which remained in effect throughout the study. These participants were selected because they displayed some spontaneous vocal communication and labeled a few objects. Jack was a 4year-old boy who communicated primarily using fourto five-word utterances and followed simple instructions. Luke was a 4-year-old boy who spoke in up to seven-word sentences and answered simple questions. Bobby was a 6-yearold boy who mainly used twoto three-word utterances to communicate, although he rarely engaged in spontaneous speech. Sal and Paul were both 5 years old, spoke in complete sentences, and followed complex demands (e.g., two or more demands presented simultaneously). None of the children had any apparent sensory or motor received medication during the course of the study. impairment or Luke and Bobby participated in Experiment 1. Jack participated in both experiments. Paul and Sal participated in Experiment 2. Sessions were conducted either at the participants’ school in a room other than the classroom or in classrooms at a university-based summer program for children with autism. The work areas contained a table and chairs or a desk, and the therapist sat either directly across from or beside the participant. Sessions were conducted 3 to 5 days a week, and one to three session blocks were conducted per day. There were four to eight sessions in each session block and no more than 16 sessions in a day. Response Measurement, Procedural Integrity, and Interobserver Agreement The primary dependent variable was the number of correct independent object labels, defined as the child stating the correct name of a pictured object without a model prompt. Data were recorded on laptop computers by previously trained graduate or undergraduate students. Number of correct labels was expressed as a percentage by dividing the number of correct responses by the total number of trials in the session and converting this ratio to a percentage. An object label was considered acquired when a correct response occurred on at least 80% of trials across three consecutive sessions. Integrity data also were collected on therapist behavior (using frequency recording) to evaluate the extent to which reinforcement was delivered as planned. Brief verbal praise was defined as a threeto four-word statement (e.g., ‘‘great job, buddy’’) at conversational level with varying tone or inflection. Enthusiastic praise was defined as a fiveto eight-word statement (e.g., ‘‘wow, you are so smart, wonderful work’’) above conversational level with varying tone or inflection, along with hand clapping. Neutral feedback was defined as a oneto two-word statement at conversational '338 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. level (e.g., ‘‘that’s right’’), delivered in monotone. Food delivery was defined as the provision of a preferred food. A trial was scored as either correct or incorrect. For the trial to be considered correct, the consequence had to be delivered as planned. That is, the therapist provided the appropriate type of consequence for an independent or prompted response within 5 s of the response. For example, if the participant exhibited a correct independent response on an unknown task trial in Experiment 1, the trial would have been scored as incorrect if the therapist delivered praise but not a food reinforcer. For each session, integrity of reinforcement delivery was calculated for unknown and known task trials by dividing the number of trials with correct reinforcement delivery by the number of trials with correct and incorrect reinforcement delivery and converting this ratio to a percentage. Across participants, mean integrity of reinforcement delivery during unknown and known trials was 97% (range, 94% to 100%) and 90% (range, 65% to 100%), respectively. independent object and comparing agreements Interobserver agreement was assessed by having a second observer collect data simultaneously but independently during a mean of 61% of the sessions (range, 19% to 85%) for each child. Agreement was determined by dividing each session into consecutive 10-s intervals (both observers scoring a correct independent object label in a 10-s interval) and disagreements (one observer scoring and one observer not scoring a correct in a 10-s interval) of the two observers. Agreement coefficients were calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements and converting this ratio to a percentage. Across participants, mean interobserver agreement on correct independent objects labels was 98% (range, 96% to 99%). Across participants, mean agreement on praise and food delivery was 99% (range, 98% to 100%) and 99% (range, 97% to 100%), respectively. label Design and Task Selection (e.g., to verify informant The primary experimental design was a combined multielement and nonconcurrent multiple baseline design. A reversal design also was used in some cases (see description below). For each child, three to eight object sets were formed. Each object set consisted of three to six unknown objects from the same category (e.g., animals, shapes, U.S. presidents). One or two objects were then assigned to each training condition (see description below). The objects were pictured on cards. Each participant’s caregivers were asked to generate a list of possible unknown and known object labels and possible known motor tasks stringing beads, putting blocks in a bucket). Each of the identified objects and motor tasks were presented to the participant during a 10-trial pretest report. Highly preferred reinforcers identified via a systematic preference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992) were provided for correct object labels that were reportedly unknown. Including a reinforcement component decreased the likelihood that a known object incorrectly classified as unknown due to noncompliance (Lerman et al., 2005). However, the type of reinforcer provided for reportedly known object labels and motor tasks depended on the experiment and phase. Correct responses produced the same reinforcers that would be used during the training condition (e.g., brief praise only). It was important to verify that these consequences would maintain responding on the known tasks while we trained the unknown object labels. An object label was classified as unknown if the participant responded correctly on 30% or fewer trials during the pretraining assessment and as known if the participant responded correctly on at least 80% of trials. label would be EXPERIMENT 1 METHOD Three conditions—constant, (similar), and interspersal interspersal (dissimilar)—were 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 339 alternated to examine the benefits of the interspersal technique when the reinforcer was selected on the basis of a systematic preference assessment and to compare the outcomes when interspersed maintenance tasks involved materials and instructions that were topographically similar or dissimilar to the unknown task. Procedure is instruction (‘‘What Baseline. Baseline consisted of 10 unknown object label trials. The same unknown object (pictured on a card) was presented each trial. To begin a trial, the therapist placed the picture card in front of the participant and delivered a verbal this?’’). The therapist moved immediately to the next trial following correct or incorrect responses or if no response occurred for 10 s. No consequences were provided for correct or incorrect responses. Constant. Sessions consisted of 10 unknown object label trials. The same unknown object was presented on each trial. The trial began as described in baseline. Initially, the therapist provided a model prompt (i.e., said the name of the object) if no response occurred within 5 s. The model prompt was faded within the session using a prompt-delay procedure to a maximum of 10 s. The delay to the prompt was increased by 1 s following three consecutive trials with a correct independent or prompted response. The trial was terminated if the child did not engage in the correct response within 5 s of the model prompt. Brief verbal praise (e.g., ‘‘good job’’) and a highly preferred food reinforcer (alternated between two food items identified via a paired-choice preference assessment) were provided for each correct independent or prompted unknown object label. If the child labeled the object incorrectly (e.g., named the wrong object), the therapist said ‘‘no,’’ and then stated the correct name of the object. All responses following error correction were ignored, and the therapist moved immediately to the next trial. Interspersal (similar). Each session consisted of 10 unknown object label trials and 10 known (e.g., object label trials. One unknown object and three known objects from the same category as the unknown object animals) were presented in each session. Each unknown object label trial was preceded by a known object label trial. The unknown and known trials were conducted in the same manner as in the constant condition with two exceptions. First, prompt fading and error correction were not used during known object trials. The model prompt was held constant and was presented if the participant did not respond within 5 s of the verbal instruction. Incorrect responses or no responses within 5 s of the model were ignored, and the therapist proceeded immediately to the trial. Second, brief verbal praise was next provided for independent or prompted known object label, and a highly preferred food reinforcer was provided for every third correct independent or prompted known response (e.g., after two independent responses and one prompted response, the preferred food was provided). each correct Interspersal (dissimilar). Procedures were similar to those described in the previous condition except that the known responses involved three motor tasks (e.g., putting blocks in a bucket, stacking rings, clapping hands, stomping feet). To begin a motor response trial, the therapist provided a verbal instruction (e.g., ‘‘clap your hands’’). After 5 s of no response, the therapist modeled the desired response. Across all treatment conditions, training was discontinued with an object label when the participant met the acquisition criterion (80% of three consecutive sessions). trials with a correct response for Several procedural modifications were made for some children and object sets after no differences were obtained across the three training conditions. First, two unknown object labels (instead of one) were assigned to each condition (Sets 2 through 5 for Jack, Sets 4 and 5 for Luke, and Sets 1 and 2 for Bobby) to increase the difficulty of the task. Second, the '340 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. labels reinforcement for both unknown and known responses was thinned for 2 participants (Sets 3 through 5 for Jack and Sets 4 and 5 for Luke) based on the results of Charlop et al. (1992). A food reinforcer was provided only for correct independent unknown object (i.e., prompted responses produced praise only), only brief verbal praise was provided for every third correct independent known object label or motor response, and neutral feedback was provided for the remaining correct known responses (i.e., food reinforcers were no longer provided for known responses, and no consequences were provided for prompted responses). Finally, the conditions were compared in a reversal design following initial acquisition (Set 4 for Jack and Sets 1 and 2 for Bobby) or during acquisition (Sets 3 and 5 for Jack) to reduce the possibility of interaction effects associated with the multielement design. RESULTS Acquisition in the constant condition was similar to or superior than acquisition in the interspersal conditions for all participants (see Figures 1 though 3). In addition, no consistent differences in levels or rates of acquisition were obtained under the two interspersal conditions. These findings were replicated even when the difficulty of the task was increased, reinforcement was thinned for the known tasks, and a reversal design was used. Mean levels of correct responding on the known task trials were above 90% for all participants during the interspersal sessions. EXPERIMENT 2 It was hypothesized that the interspersal technique did not improve performance beyond that obtained in the constant condition because high-quality reinforcers were used, which produced a ceiling effect. That the rapid acquisition of object labels under the constant condition suggested that there was limited room for improvement when the interspersal procedure was combined with reinforcement. The is, reinforcers were highly preferred food items combined with praise, even though praise alone was used in most studies that have demonstrated the benefits of the interspersal procedure (e.g., Browder & Shear, 1996; Neef et al., 1977, 1980). Thus, in Experiment 2, acquisition of object labels was compared across the constant and interspersal conditions when either highquality reinforcement food or enthusiastic praise) or low-quality reinforcement (brief praise only) was provided for correct responses to the unknown tasks. Nonetheless, the interspersal procedure still provided no benefit over the constant condition for 2 of 3 participants. Therefore, high-quality reinforcers were introduced for correct known responses based on the results of Mace et al. (1997). (praise plus METHOD Procedure The procedure for baseline and the constant and interspersal training conditions was identical to that described above, with the exception of the reinforcement procedure during the training conditions. Two unknown object labels were assigned to each training condition, and one interspersal condition was alternated with the constant condition. With some exceptions (see results below), training was discontinued with an object label when the participant met the acquisition criterion (80% of trials with a correct response for three consecutive sessions) or the acquisition criterion within 10 sessions of the first object label acquired in the set. failed to meet if the participant Interspersal versus constant with high-quality reinforcement. Only Sal (Set 1) and Paul (Sets 1 and 2) were exposed to this condition because Jack participated in this condition during Experiment 1 (Sets 1 through 5). Praise and highly preferred food reinforcers identified via a paired-choice preference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992) were provided following each correct independent and prompted unknown object label for Sal. During Sal’s interspersal sessions, brief verbal praise was provided for each correct 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 341 Figure 1. Percentage of correct independent object labels for Jack during Experiment 1. '342 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. Figure 2. Percentage of correct independent object labels for Luke during Experiment 1.

Percentage of correct independent object labels for Bobby during Experiment 1. independent or prompted known response, and a highly preferred food reinforcer was provided for every third correct independent or prompted known response (the same contingency used for Jack in Experiment 1). Anecdotal observations during Paul’s initial sessions indicated that enthusiastic praise functioned as a potent reinforcer for responding and appeared to be equally or more preferred than food reinforcers. Thus, enthusiastic praise was delivered following each correct independent unknown and known object label, and brief verbal praise was provided following each prompted unknown and known object label for Paul. Interspersal versus constant with low-quality reinforcement. All participants were exposed to labels. The consequences this condition (Sets 2 and 3 for Sal; Sets 6, 7, and 8 for Jack; and Sets 3 and 4 for Paul). Brief verbal praise (e.g., saying ‘‘good job, Jack’’) was provided for each correct independent unknown object label, and feedback (e.g., saying ‘‘right’’ or ‘‘correct’’ in a neutral tone of voice) was provided for correct prompted unknown object for correct known responses varied somewhat across participants. For Sal, brief verbal praise was provided following every third correct known response, and neutral feedback was provided for the responses. No consequences were provided for correct prompted known responses. However, for Jack and Paul, schedule was the reinforcement remaining correct known '344 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. modified slightly after Jack’s compliance with known tasks began to decrease across sessions. Brief verbal praise was provided following each correct known response, and neutral feedback was provided for prompted known responses. Interspersal versus constant with high-quality reinforcement for known responses. This condition was introduced for Jack (Sets 7 and 8) when he failed to meet the acquisition criteria after a lengthy number of sessions under the previous condition. The comparison was then replicated with Paul (Sets 5 and 6), who did not show differential responding in the previous condition. As in the previous condition, each correct unknown object label was followed by brief praise. However, brief verbal praise and a highly preferred food item (Jack) or enthusiastic praise (Paul) was provided for each correct known response (Mace et al., 1997). RESULTS Results are organized on the basis of the procedures used because different procedures were employed across object sets. For Sal and Paul, acquisition under the constant condition was similar to or superior than acquisition under the interspersal condition when praise plus food were provided for correct responses (see Set 1 for Sal and Sets 1 and 2 for Paul in Figure 4). This replicates the results obtained in Experiment 1. It should be noted that Sal’s sessions with Set 1 were discontinued before he met the acquisition criterion due to time constraints (end of the school year). Inconsistent results were obtained across participants when brief praise only (a presumably lower quality reinforcer) was used instead. When Jack received praise alone for correct responses, he required 15 sessions to meet the acquisition criteria in the interspersal condition but had not done so after 20 sessions in the constant condition (Set 6; Figure 5). However, this outcome was not replicated across two other object sets because Jack failed to meet the acquisition criterion despite numerous training sessions (see further discussion of those object sets below). For Sal, object labels were acquired much more rapidly in the interspersal condition than in the constant condition when brief praise was delivered for correct responses (Sets 2 and 3; Figure 5). Although there was an initial clear advantage to the interspersal condition over the constant condition for Set 3, performance began to improve under the constant condition after sixth training session. However, sessions could not be continued due to time constraints (end of school year). This differential effect was not replicated with Paul (Sets 3 and 4; Figure 5). the As noted above, Jack had not acquired the object labels in Sets 7 and 8 under either the constant or interspersal conditions after a lengthy number of sessions when he received only praise for correct responses. Thus, training with these object sets continued; however, highquality reinforcement (food reinforcers combined with praise) was introduced for correct known responses (beginning with Session 44 in Set 7 and 42 in Set 8) (Mace et al., 1997). For both object the acquisition criterion for the object labels in the interspersal condition but not in the constant condition after high-quality reinforcement was introduced for correct known responses (see Figure 6). Jack met sets, Procedures used with Jack were replicated to determine if providing highwith Paul quality reinforcement for known responses would enhance the effectiveness of the interspersal procedure. As shown in Figure 6, Paul met the acquisition criterion in fewer sessions under the interspersal condition than under the constant condition with Sets 5 and 6. for Sal was Mean levels of correct responding on the known task trials were above 90% for Jack and Paul during the interspersal sessions. The mean level (76%). Interestingly, correct responding on the known task trials was generally above 90% for Sal except when praise plus food reinforcers were provided for both known and unknown tasks. somewhat lower 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 345 Figure 4. Percentage of correct independent object labels during the interspersal and constant conditions with highquality reinforcement for Sal and Paul in Experiment 2. DISCUSSION Overall, results showed no benefit to interspersing mastered tasks with new tasks when highly preferred food reinforcers and praise (or enthusiastic praise for Paul) were provided for correct unknown object labels. Results of Experiment 1 further indicated that the type of task interspersed (similar vs. dissimilar) did not influence the effectiveness of the interspersal procedure. Results of the exploratory analyses in Experiment 2 were more equivocal. For one participant (Sal), performance clearly improved under the interspersal condition relative to the constant condition when only brief praise was delivered for correct responses for Sets 2 and 3. These results suggest that the negative outcomes obtained in Experiment 1 were due to ceiling effects, and that the interspersal technique may not provide additional benefits when highly potent reinforcers are used. The interspersal technique may function primarily as a motivating operation by increasing the reinforcing value of the consequence for correct responses. Further increases in reinforcer value, however, may not occur when highly preferred reinforcers are provided for correct responding. Nonetheless, the results for Sal were only partially replicated with the other participants (with one of three object sets for Jack and none of the object sets for Paul). In fact, acquisition was more difficult when only brief praise was used (see Sets 7 and 8 for Jack and Set 4 for Paul), regardless of whether known tasks were '346 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. Figure 5. Percentage of correct independent object labels during the interspersal and constant conditions with lowquality reinforcement for Jack, Sal, and Paul in Experiment 2. 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 347 Figure 6. Percentage of correct independent object labels during the interspersal and constant conditions with highquality reinforcement for known responses only in Experiment 2 for Jack and Paul. interspersed with unknown tasks. This might be expected if brief praise functioned as a relatively weak reinforcer. Acquisition for these participants appeared to be enhanced in the interspersal condition (relative to the constant condition) when high-quality reinforcers (food reinforcers combined with praise for Jack or enthusiastic praise for Paul) were provided for correct responses on known task trials, even though brief praise continued to be delivered for correct responses on unknown task trials. This latter finding is interesting because it is inconsistent with recommendations for using the interspersal technique (Charlop et al., 1992). However, this finding is analogous to that of Mace et al. (1997), suggesting that '348 VALERIE M. VOLKERT et al. similar mechanisms may be associated with the high-probability instructional and interspersal procedures. sequence It should be noted that the quality of praise relative to praise plus highly preferred food reinforcers (or enthusiastic praise) was assumed rather than objectively determined. Although this limits our understanding of the outcomes, the reinforcers were selected based on prior relevant studies (e.g., Charlop et al., 1992; Mace et al., 1988, 1997; Neef et al., 1980) so that the results would be directly comparable. In fact, results of the current investigation may have differed from those obtained with typically developing children because praise and other forms of feedback for correct responding may be a less potent form of reinforcement for children with autism. Therefore, children with autism may have responded differently than in previously published studies because praise as a reinforcer may not have served as a similarly powerful reinforcer. Nonetheless, broad conclusions about the effectiveness of the interspersal technique cannot be drawn on the basis of this study because other variables may be important to its effectiveness. For example, only one or two object labels were taught during each instructional session, far fewer than the number of unknown tasks taught in previous studies on the interspersal technique (Dunlap, 1984; Neef et al., 1980). This could have generated a ceiling effect on performance, limiting the impact of the interspersal procedure in this study. The effects of interspersing known tasks with unknown tasks may depend on the number of tasks taught simultaneously or the difficulty level of those tasks. The interspersal technique also may be beneficial when a child’s failure to respond correctly is due, at least in part, to noncompliance rather than to a skill deficit. In the current investigation, the pretraining task assessment was designed to increase the likelihood that object labels would be correctly classified as unknown because highly preferred reinforcers it appears were delivered for correct responses. Moreover, the participants’ problem behavior, including noncompliance to task demands, was exposed to escape extinction throughout the study. Nonetheless, the differences across conditions may have reflected differences in response maintenance rather than acquisition in some cases. For example, Jack correctly labeled 100% of the objects in Sets 6, 7, and 8 under the constant condition even though he failed to meet the acquisition criterion. that for and interspersal each participant Some authors have suggested that reinforcement rate may be important to the effectiveness of the interspersal technique (Neef et al., 1977, 1980; Rowan & Pear, 1985). Mean rates of reinforcement in the constant conditions were calculated by dividing the number of reinforcers earned by the number of minutes in the session (combined reinforcers were considered a single reinforcer). No consistent relation was found between differential rates of reinforcement and training outcome. For instance, in Experiment 1 for all participants, mean rates of reinforcement were lower in the constant condition than in the interspersal conditions. Although rates of reinforcement were always lower in the constant condition, acquisition was sometimes superior to one or both of the interspersal conditions; at other times acquisition was equivalent to the interspersal conditions. this The present study contains additional limitations that warrant discussion. First, results may have been influenced by carryover effects the due to rapidly alternated conditions of multielement design. However, seems unlikely given that interspersal still provided no benefits over the constant condition when a reversal design was used in Experiment 1. Second, sets were terminated prematurely for Sal due to time constraints. Third, the number of trials was not equivalent across the constant and interspersal conditions. The increase in trials (and session length) during the interspersal sessions may sessions with two object 'TASK-INTERSPERSAL PROCEDURES 349 sessions which, have increased the aversiveness of the instructional in turn, may have decreased compliance with the acquisition task. In addition, the acquisition tasks differed across the constant and interspersal conditions. The longer intertrial interval during the interspersal conditions may have hindered acquisition in some instances. the intertrial interval for Further examination of commonly used procedures such as task interspersal and highprobability instructional sequences is needed to improve our understanding of these instructional strategies and to further develop best practices for individuals with developmental disabilities. In particular, future investigations should determine if high-probability instructional sequences and interspersal procedures share the same underlying mechanism. Other factors that may interact with the efficacy of interspersal procedures also should be examined, including the number of skills taught simultaneously and preference for the interspersed task. Although more research is needed, these findings indicate that clinicians and researchers should not assume that interspersing known tasks with unknown tasks is superior to teaching acquisition tasks alone.

Although previous studies have\\nevaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies\\nhave demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of\\nthe present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant\\nestablishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem-\\nplar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa-\\ntion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios\\nwithin a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to\\nnovel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time. Social validity for the\\nintervention had an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7).',\n",

       " 'state that “what?” and “where?” typically are learned first, followed by “who?”\\n“when?” “how?” “why?” and lastly “which?” and “whose?” In contrast, children with\\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD) often need specific teaching to learn these skills.\\nAlthough studies have evaluated procedures for teaching the mands “where?” (e.g.,\\nEndicott & Higbee, 2007; Howlett, Sidener, Progar, & Sidener, 2011; Somers, Sidener,\\nDeBar, & Sidener, 2014; Sundberg et al., 2002), “what?” (e.g., Esbenshade & Rosales-\\nRuiz, 2001; Koegel, Koegel, Green-Hopkins, & Barnes, 2010; Williams, Donley, &\\nKeller, 2000), “who?” (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Lechago, Carr, Grow, Love, &\\nAlmason, 2010; Shillingsburg, Bowen, Valentino, & Pierce, 2014; Sundberg et al.,\\n2002), “when?” (e.g., Landa, Hansen, & Shillingsburg, 2017; Shillingsburg, Valentino,\\nBowen, Bradley, & Zavatkey, 2011), and “how?” (e.g., Shillingsburg & Valentino,\\n2011), no studies to date have evaluated an intervention for teaching the mand for\\ninformation “why?” to children with ASD.',\n",
       " 'Research on teaching the mand “why?” may be limited for a number of reasons.\\nFirst, it may be difficult to bring this mand under natural reinforcer control because the\\nconsequence (i.e., information about why) may not function as a reinforcer for some\\nchildren with ASD. To address this issue when teaching other mands for information,\\nmost studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in\\naccess to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011),\\nmanding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to\\nsubsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred\\nactivity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?”\\nresulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It\\nmay be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning\\nthe reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For\\nexample, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in\\nthe middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is\\ninformation (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity.',\n",
       " 'Second, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand\\n“how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring\\nthat an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason\\nfor something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs\\nfor the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present.\\nFor example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the\\nreason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that\\ninformation as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse-\\nquence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach\\nthe mand “why?”',\n",
       " 'Despite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?”\\nresearchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of\\nskill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the\\nenvironment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and\\nexpand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore,\\nthe purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand\\n“why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described\\npreviously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three\\ndifferent EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD',\n",

In addition, we\\nsystematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa-\\ntion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an\\nalternative preferred item).',\n",
       " 'To address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching\\nopportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders,\\n2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of\\nnovel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve,\\nBrothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children\\nwith ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial\\nfacilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel\\nevent on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?”',\n",
       " 'Different topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g.,\\n“Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that\\nmanding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being\\ngeneralized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we\\nspeculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would\\nbe more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what\\ninformation to provide.',\n",

Although previous studies have\\nevaluated interventions for teaching other mands for information, to date no studies\\nhave demonstrated effective procedures for teaching the mand “why?” The purpose of\\nthe present study was to teach 3 children with ASD to mand “why?” under relevant\\nestablishing operation conditions in 3 distinct scenarios. A trial-unique multiple-exem-\\nplar procedure was used to promote generalization and increase the value of informa-\\ntion provided across trials. All 3 participants learned to mand “why?” in all 3 scenarios\\nwithin a mean of 18 sessions (range 14–21 sessions), demonstrated generalization to\\nnovel stimuli and settings, and maintained this skill over time. Social validity for the\\nintervention had an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7).\\n\\nKeywords Mand . Information . Trial-unique . Why\\n\\nTypically developing children are often proficient with many mands for information by\\npreschool (Rowland & Pine, 2000; Sundberg, Loeb, Hale, & Eigenheer, 2002). The\\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) asserts that typically devel-\\noping children ask “why?” between 2 and 3 years of age and ask “when?” and “how?”\\nbetween 4 and 5 years (ASHA, n.d.). Rowland, Pine, Lieven, and Theakston (2003)\\n\\nThis study is based on a thesis submitted by the first author, under the supervision of the second author, to the\\nDepartment of Applied Behavior Analysis at Caldwell University for the Master of Arts in Applied Behavior\\nAnalysis.\\n\\n* Tina M.

To address this issue when teaching other mands for information,\\nmost studies have established a chain in which the information ultimately resulted in\\naccess to a preferred item. For example, in Shillingsburg and Valentino (2011),\\nmanding “how?” resulted in information about how to unmute a computer, leading to\\nsubsequent access to playing a game on the computer with sound (i.e., preferred\\nactivity). Similarly, in Howlett et al. (2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?”\\nresulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. It\\nmay be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning\\nthe reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. For\\nexample, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in\\nthe middle of the room) and asks “Why is that there?” a common consequence is\\ninformation (e.g., “I’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity.\\n\\nSecond, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand\\n“how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring\\nthat an establishing operation (EO) controls the response. That is, providing a reason\\nfor something is typically an abolishing operation (AO) for asking “why?”; hence EOs\\nfor the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present.\\nFor example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the\\nreason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that\\ninformation as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse-\\nquence). Therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an EO to teach\\nthe mand “why?”\\n\\nDespite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?”\\nresearchers have noted that it is important for children with ASD to learn this type of\\nskill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the\\nenvironment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and\\nexpand language skills and social opportunities (Shillingsburg et al., 2011). Therefore,\\nthe purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand\\n“why?” to children diagnosed with ASD. To address the first challenge described\\npreviously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three\\ndifferent EO conditions that were selected based on observation of children with ASD\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n3\\n\\nand typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa-\\ntion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. In addition, we\\nsystematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa-\\ntion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an\\nalternative preferred item).\\n\\nTo address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching\\nopportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (Williams, Johnston, & Saunders,\\n2006). Previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of\\nnovel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. For example, Gomes, Reeve,\\nBrothers, Reeve, & Sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children\\nwith ASD to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial\\nfacilitated EO control of bids. The current study used this strategy of presenting a novel\\nevent on every trial to facilitate EO control of the mand “why?”\\n\\nDifferent topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g.,\\n“Why can’t I have it?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why is that there?”) to ensure that\\nmanding was under the control of the EO for that precise condition rather than being\\ngeneralized manding resulting from training in another condition. Additionally, we\\nspeculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would\\nbe more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what\\ninformation to provide.\\n\\nWe programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed\\ngeneralization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. Main-\\ntenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion. Finally,\\nBoard Certified Behavior Analysts and special education teachers were asked to assess\\nthe social validity of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study.\\n\\nMethod\\n\\nParticipants and Setting\\n\\nThe participants were three children who had been previously diagnosed with ASD:\\nGianna (9 years, 11 months), Brandon (18 years, 4 months), and Ken (8 years, 1 month).\\nAll participants attended educational programs that provided comprehensive behavior-\\nanalytic instruction. They all demonstrated mastery of manding for preferred items,\\nmanding “where?”, imitating a question/phrase with at least five syllables, initiating joint\\nattention with at least one type of response for two scenarios, and waiting 60 s for a\\npreferred item when presented with the instruction “Wait.” Caregivers and instructors\\nreported that the participants had not learned to mand “why?” and that this was an\\nimportant skill for them to learn. Sessions were conducted in a room in a university-\\nbased autism center or in the participant’s home during teaching trials and in other settings\\nin the participant’s natural environment (e.g., outside, library) during generalization probes.\\n\\nPreexperimental Assessments\\n\\nPreference assessment A questionnaire based on the Reinforcer Assessment for Indi-\\nviduals With Severe Disabilities (Fisher, Piazza, Bowman, & Amari, 1996) was\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nadministered to parents and teachers of each participant before the study to identify\\npreferred items. The 12 highest ranked items were selected from a paired-stimulus\\npreference assessment (Fisher et al., 1992). Teachers were also asked to identify an\\nadditional 12 items that were similar to the high-preference items (i.e., in the same\\ncategory) to be used as alternative items during EO trials of the restricted access\\nscenario. Access to all high-preference items was restricted to experimental sessions\\nonly.\\n\\nSkills assessments Four skills assessments were conducted to ensure participants\\ndemonstrated the skills necessary for inclusion in the study: repeating questions from\\na voice recorder, initiating joint attention, tacting emotions, and choosing preferred\\nitems from a pictorial choice board. All participants responded correctly and indepen-\\ndently during all the following assessments such that no further teaching was required.\\nThe voice-recorder assessment evaluated whether the participants vocally imitated\\nthree questions played on a voice recorder to ensure the prerecorded prompt used in the\\nstudy would evoke echoic responding (Somers et al., 2014). The questions used in this\\nassessment had four, five, and six syllables (as the models in the study) but did not\\nshare any of the same words as the models in the study. The experimenter stood 0.5 m\\nfrom the participant and played the recorded question for the participant to repeat. A\\ncorrect response was defined as the participant emitting the complete question correctly\\nand independently within 5 s.\\n\\nThe joint attention assessment was used to evaluate whether participants initiated\\nbids for joint attention, as this was a necessary skill for the observation of the unusual\\nevents scenario. A correct response was defined as the participant engaging in at least\\none of these responses within 3 min of an unusual event being encountered as the\\nparticipant walked through the hallway or outside: pointing to or touching the unusual\\nitem, manding for attention (e.g., “Look!”), looking at the object and then at the\\nexperimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”).\\n\\nThe tact assessment was used to evaluate whether the participants could tact\\nemotions from facial expressions. The experimenter showed 14 photographs of two\\ndifferent people demonstrating seven different facial expressions (used during the\\nstudy) and asked the participant “What is she/he doing?” A correct response was\\ndefined as the participant tacting the emotion correctly and independently within 5 s\\nof the photograph being presented.\\n\\nThe choice-board assessment evaluated whether the participants could make choices\\nfor preferred items from photographs on a choice board. The experimenter presented a\\nchoice board with an array of 12 photographs of items identified in the preference\\nassessment and asked, “What do you want?” A correct response was defined as the\\nparticipant selecting a picture from the choice board and giving it to the experimenter\\nwithin 5 s (or pointing to a picture and vocally manding for it within 5 s), selecting the\\ncorresponding item from a box, and engaging with the item.\\n\\nMaterials, Scenarios, and Scripts\\n\\nTo identify scenarios likely to function as EOs for information about why something\\nhappened, we observed a classroom of 10 preschoolers who ranged from 2.5 to 4 years\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n5\\n\\nold. The observation was conducted over 2 days, and each observation period lasted for\\n3 hr. The experimenter sat at the back of a classroom and observed the preschool\\nstudents without interacting. Results showed that the most common antecedents to\\nasking “why?” were seeing other children engaging in emotional responding (e.g.,\\ncrying), and being denied access to preferred items and activities. Because of this,\\nrestricted access to preferred items and observation of emotional responses were\\nselected as two of the scenarios to use in the current study for teaching the mand\\n“why?” We also included a third scenario, unusual events, because the participants had\\ndemonstrated bids for joint attention to unusual events in the past.\\n\\nFor the restricted access condition, 24 preferred items were used for each participant.\\nFor the unusual events condition, 60 different scenarios were used that were deemed to\\nbe salient and not likely to occur in the setting in which sessions were conducted (see\\nTable 1 for examples). For the emotional responses condition, 48 videos depicting\\nseven emotional responses and different reasons with four different people (i.e., each\\nperson recorded 12 videos; see Table 2 for examples) and 28 videos depicting routine\\nactions/activities were used. Emotional responses were those that all participants could\\ntact and were age appropriate. A voice recorder was used to provide echoic prompts.\\nThe scripts used were recorded with a peer of the same gender to provide a socially\\nvalid model, and an iPad was used to record all sessions for subsequent data collection.\\nDuring the restricted access condition, a 30 cm × 35 cm laminated board, affixed with\\nVelcro with 12 photographs of items on one side and three photographs of items used\\nfor generalization probe trials on the other side, was used as a choice board. A laptop\\ncomputer was used to show videos during the emotional responses condition.\\n\\nExperimental Design and Data Collection\\n\\nA concurrent multiple-baseline design across three scenario types (i.e., restricted access\\nto preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events) was used to demonstrate\\nthe effects of the intervention with each participant. The order of scenario types was\\ncounterbalanced across participants (i.e., Gianna: restricted access, emotional re-\\nsponses, unusual scenarios; Brandon: emotional responses, unusual scenarios, restricted\\naccess; Ken: unusual scenarios, restricted access, emotional responses). During each\\ntrial, the participant’s response was scored as correct or incorrect. A correct response\\nduring EO trials was defined as the participant independently saying the full mand for\\ninformation (i.e., “Why is that there?” “Why is he/she doing that?” “Why can’t I have\\nit?”) within 10 s of the unavailability statement, end of the video, or the participant\\nindicating the unusual event. Equivalent mands (e.g., “Why is she laughing?”) were\\nalso scored as correct. Indicating an unusual event was defined as the participant\\npointing to it or touching it, manding for attention to it (e.g., “Look.”), looking at it\\nand then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “Umbrella!”). AO1\\n(Abolishing Operation 1) trials, in which the information/reason was immediately\\nprovided, and AO2 trials, in which the participants were not exposed to restricted\\naccess, emotional responding, or unusual events, were scored as incorrect if the\\nparticipant said “why” at any point during the trial. Data were summarized and graphed\\nas the percentage of independent correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2\\ntrials, generalization EO trials, generalization AO1 trials, and generalization AO2 trials\\nper session.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nTable 1 Examples of Unusual Scenarios\\n\\nType\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nScenario\\n\\nReason\\n\\nAction\\n\\nPitcher of water on desk\\n\\nThis was left over from watering the\\n\\nLet’s go dump it out.\\n\\nEmoji pillows on floor\\n\\nSomeone forgot these.\\n\\nplants.\\n\\nClothes scattered on\\n\\nbathroom floor\\n\\nThe bin must have tipped over.\\n\\nCotton balls in lunch bag\\n\\nThis says “Sharon.”\\n\\nLet’s give them to\\n\\nDebbie.\\n\\nLet’s put them back.\\n\\nLet’s go put it in\\nSharon’s office.\\n\\nWater bottles on computer\\n\\nThese are for all your teachers.\\n\\nWant to help give them\\n\\nchair\\n\\nPlay\\n\\nStar Wars figurines in\\n\\nChris was playing with them.\\n\\nhallway\\n\\nout?\\n\\nLet’s get Chris to play\\n\\nwith us!\\n\\nGlitter bottles on table\\n\\nSomeone was making a card.\\n\\nWant to play with\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nonly\\n\\nAlec left it for us.\\n\\nGlobe on desk\\nPom-poms scattered on floor Tasha was playing snowball fight.\\nRed car with remote on desk Clem was playing with it.\\nBirds hanging from the door Gemma was playing zoo.\\nA picnic set up on sidewalk Someone’s going to have a picnic.\\nI think someone is cleaning out the\\nUtensils spread all over\\n\\nkitchen counter\\n\\nkitchen cabinets.\\n\\nthem?\\n\\nWant to see it?\\nLet’s play!\\nWant to try it?\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\nDebbie’s chair upside down Debbie must be fixing her chair.\\nFlowers in big bag on\\n\\nLaney was pretending it’s a flower\\n\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\nkitchen floor\\n\\nstore.\\n\\nTable 2 Examples of Emotional Responses\\n\\nEmotion He/she’s [emotion] because …\\n\\nHappy\\nTired\\nHurt\\nSad\\n\\nShe’s eating candy.\\nShe’s doing a lot of exercises.\\nThe door shut on his finger.

Each session\\nconsisted of 12 trials: five EO trials, two AO1 trials, two AO2 trials, and generalization\\nprobe trials for EO, AO1, and AO2. Trials were quasi-randomly ordered every session,\\nwith no more than two EO trials in a row. The purpose of EO trials was to contrive an\\nEO to teach the mand “why?” for the particular condition. The purpose of the AO1 and\\nAO2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an EO and not\\nsomething about the experimental preparation. During AO1 trials, participants were\\nimmediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not\\nhave an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an\\nunusual event) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants\\nwere not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is,\\nthey were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board,\\nwatched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in\\nthe environment, so there was no EO for manding “why?”\\n\\nA trial-unique procedure was used for all three scenarios to maintain the value of\\ninformation for the mand “why?” Within each scenario, relevant features such as\\npreferred items, unavailability statements, reasons, and alternative items (restricted\\naccess scenario); emotional responses, people, and reasons (emotional responses sce-\\nnario); and unusual events, reasons, and related actions (unusual events scenario) were\\ncounterbalanced across trials and trial types so that manding would not come under the\\ncontrol of any specific features or combination of features.\\n\\nBaseline During all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the\\nexperimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items\\nand said “Which one do you want?” or “Pick one.” During AO1 trials in baseline, when\\nthe participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail-\\nability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item.\\nFor example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “Oh! You\\ncan’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said\\n“But you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. During AO2 trials in\\nbaseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to\\nthe item and said “Sure! You can have it.” During EO trials in baseline, when the item\\nwas selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “You\\ncan’t have it.”). If the participant manded “Why can’t I have it?” within 10 s, the\\nexperimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative,\\nrelated item as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within\\n10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next” and put\\nthe items away.\\n\\nDuring all trials in baseline sessions of the emotional responses scenario, the\\nexperimenter showed a video of someone engaging in an emotional response. During\\nAO1 trials in baseline, 10 s after the video ended, the experimenter provided a reason\\nusing a tone and facial expression that matched the emotion and played the next part of\\nthe video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, if a\\nparticipant watched a video of a girl laughing, the experimenter paused the video and\\nsaid “She’s laughing because someone tickled her!” and played the next part of the\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nvideo that showed someone tickling the girl. During AO2 trials in baseline, a video of\\nsomeone engaging in a routine action with a neutral expression was shown to the\\nparticipant. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant manded “Why is he/she\\ndoing that?” within 10 s of the video ending, the experimenter provided the reason as\\ndescribed previously. If the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the\\nexperimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.”\\n\\nDuring all trials of baseline sessions of the unusual events scenario, the experimenter\\nwalked with the participant to a different room or hallway or outside. During AO1 trials\\nin baseline, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter\\nprovided a reason for it being there and an action related to it. For example, if a\\nparticipant opened his or her backpack and found a pillow, the experimenter said “This\\nsays ‘Meghan’—Meghan must have left this here—let’s go put it in her office” and\\nwalked with the participant to Meghan’s office to put it there. During AO2 trials in\\nbaseline, there was nothing unusual in the environment. For example, when a participant\\nwalked into the classroom and there was nothing unusual, the participant continued with\\nhis or her daily schedule. During EO trials in baseline, if the participant correctly\\nmanded “Why is that there?” within 10 s, the experimenter immediately provided a\\nreason and continued as described previously. If the participant did not mand correctly\\nwithin 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “OK, let’s see what’s next.”\\n\\nMand training Training sessions were identical to baseline sessions with the following\\nexceptions. During EO trials of the restricted access scenario, when the participant\\nselected the item, the experimenter immediately provided an unavailability statement\\nand played the recorded prompt “Why can’t I have it?” out of the participant’s view.\\nAfter the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately\\nprovided an appropriate reason and offered an alternative item in a similar category.\\nDuring EO trials of the emotional responses scenario, 10 s after the participant watched\\nthe video, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is he/she doing that?”\\nout of the participant’s view. After the participant successfully echoed the model, the\\nexperimenter immediately provided the reason and played the next part of the video\\nthat showed the reason for the emotional responding. For example, after the participant\\nwatched the first part of the video, which showed a boy hurt (i.e., saying “Ouch!”), and\\nsuccessfully echoed the recorded prompt, the experimenter immediately said “He’s hurt\\nbecause the door shut on his finger!” and played the second part of the video showing\\nthe reason the boy was hurt (i.e., his finger getting caught in the door). During EO trials\\nof the unusual events scenario, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual\\nevent, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “Why is that there?” out of the\\nparticipant’s view. After the participant engaged in the echoic, the experimenter\\nimmediately provided an appropriate reason and then suggested (a) helping to fix the\\nsituation, (b) playing with the item, or (c) nothing else.\\n\\nAfter meeting criterion during the full-script condition (i.e., 100% correct responding\\nwith or without scripts for two consecutive sessions), a baseline (no-script) probe was\\nconducted to test for independent manding. If a participant responded at 100% accuracy\\nfor two consecutive sessions independently, the skill was considered mastered.\\n\\nGeneralization To assess generalization, three generalization trials were conducted\\nunder baseline conditions during each session. These trials were conducted by novel\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n9\\n\\ninstructors or caregivers (i.e., familiar to the participant but not involved in the study) in\\nnovel settings (e.g., outside, on a walk, in the library). During EO trials of the restricted\\naccess scenario, we used a different colored choice board with photographs of three\\nitems that were not identified via the preference assessment but were nominated by\\nteachers/caregivers as items that were manded for on a daily basis. During EO trials of\\nthe emotional responses scenario, a novel instructor acted out emotional responses\\nin vivo. During EO trials of the unusual events scenario, novel unusual events occurred.\\nFor all AO1 and AO2 trials during generalization for all three scenarios, procedures\\nsimilar to baseline were followed.\\n\\nMaintenance Maintenance probes were conducted 1 week after a participant reached\\nthe mastery criterion, and followed the same procedures as baseline. Instructors/\\ncaregivers were asked to provide two opportunities to mand for each scenario for the\\nEO condition and two opportunities for the AO1 and AO2 conditions each day between\\nthe conclusion of the study and the maintenance probe.\\n\\nInterobserver Agreement and Procedural Integrity\\n\\nInterobserver agreement (IOA) data were collected for 50% of baseline sessions,\\nintervention sessions, and maintenance sessions. An agreement was defined as both\\nobservers recording a trial as correct or incorrect. IOA was calculated using point-by-\\npoint agreement by dividing the number of agreements over the total number of\\nagreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100%. IOA was 100% for all three\\nparticipants.\\n\\nProcedural integrity data were taken during 50% of all baseline, intervention, and\\nmaintenance sessions for all three participants by secondary observers via video\\nrecordings. A trial was scored as correct if all of the following were correct: statements,\\nprompts, consequences, materials, and timing. Procedural integrity data were calculated\\nby dividing the total number of correct trials over the total number of correct and\\nincorrect trials and multiplying by 100%. Mean procedural integrity was 98% (range\\n97%–100%) for Brandon and 100% for Gianna and Ken.\\n\\nSocial Validity\\n\\nThree special education teachers and two Board Certified Behavior Analysts were\\ngiven brief descriptions of the procedures and shown videos of each condition. They\\ncompleted a modified Treatment Acceptability Rating Form–Revised (TARF-R;\\nReimers & Wacker, 1988), which uses a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = disagree\\nstrongly; 7 = agree strongly).\\n\\nResults\\n\\nData on the percentage of correct responses for all participants are presented in Figs. 1\\nthrough 3. As can be seen in Fig. 1, during baseline Gianna responded correctly during\\nAO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\nin the restricted access to preferred items condition (top panel), Gianna reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. Although she did not ask “why?”\\nduring two EO trials (Sessions 13 and 15), asked “where’s [item]?” during one AO1\\ntrial (Session 14), and asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 15), no procedural\\nmodifications were needed. When the script was removed, she met the mastery\\ncriterion in two sessions. During mand training in the emotional responses condition\\n(middle panel), Gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions.\\nWhen the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in three sessions. During\\nmand training in the unusual events condition (bottom panel), Gianna reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script and with the script removed in two sessions each.\\nAs can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, during baseline of the emotional responses\\ncondition, Brandon responded correctly during AO1 and AO2 trials and did not mand\\n“why?” during EO trials. He did not ask “why?” during five EO trials (Sessions 11 and 17)\\nand asked “why?” during one AO1 trial (Session 17). He reached the mastery criterion\\nwith the full script in five sessions and with the script removed in three sessions. A similar\\npattern was observed in the unusual events condition (middle panel): He reached the\\nmastery criterion with the full script in four sessions and with the script removed in two\\nsessions. A different pattern was observed during the restricted access condition. Although\\nhis caregivers reported that he had not previously learned to mand “why?” and he did not\\nmand “why?” during baseline of the other conditions, during the first four sessions of\\nbaseline of the restricted access condition (bottom panel), Brandon manded “why not?”\\n“how come?” and “why can’t I have [item]?” during 50% of EO trials. However, he also\\nmade errors during 50% of EO trials, 50% of AO1 trials, and 100% of EO generalization\\ntrials of those sessions (i.e., for the AO1 trials, Brandon manded “why?” even when the\\ninstructor provided a reason, and for the EO trials and the EO generalization trials,\\nBrandon did not mand “why?”). After reaching the mastery criterion in the emotional\\nresponses condition (i.e., top panel), he subsequently scored 100% during all trials of the\\nnext four sessions in the restricted access condition without teaching.\\n\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, during baseline Ken responded correctly during AO1 and\\nAO2 trials and did not mand “why?” during EO trials. During mand training in the\\nunusual events condition (top panel), he reached the mastery criterion for the full-script\\ncondition in five sessions and for the no-script condition in four sessions. During this\\nscenario, Ken asked “why?” during two AO1 trials (Sessions 10 and 17). During mand\\ntraining in the restricted access condition (middle panel), Ken reached the mastery\\ncriterion for the full-script condition in three sessions and for the no-script condition in\\ntwo sessions. Similarly, in the emotional responses condition, he reached the mastery\\ncriterion for both the full-script and no-script conditions in two sessions each.\\n\\nAs with acquisition, all participants demonstrated generalized manding quickly. Only one\\nparticipant, Ken, made an error during a generalization trial of the no-script condition. During\\nSession 18, during the AO1 trial, after the experimenter provided the reason for the unusual\\nevent, Ken asked “Where should the star bucket go?” Interestingly, during the full-script\\ncondition of the emotional responses condition, Gianna initially engaged in errors during\\ngeneralization EO trials and generalization AO1 trials and responded with laughter and\\nstereotypy (e.g., when the novel instructor acted out the scenario for surprise, Gianna started\\nlaughing and talking about a cartoon video clip). Subsequently, a procedural modification\\nwas made during Sessions 23, 24, and 25 to temporarily make the generalization conditions\\n(i.e., in vivo presentation of emotional responding) more like the teaching conditions (i.e.,\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n11\\n\\nBaseline                          Full Script\\n\\nNo Script                        Maintenance\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\n0\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\ns\\ne\\ns\\nn\\no\\np\\ns\\ne\\nR\\n\\n \\nt\\nc\\ne\\nr\\nr\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\nt\\nn\\ne\\nd\\nn\\ne\\np\\ne\\nd\\nn\\nI\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nw\\n \\ns\\nl\\na\\ni\\nr\\nT\\n \\nf\\no\\n\\n \\ne\\ng\\na\\nt\\nn\\ne\\nc\\nr\\ne\\nP\\n\\nRestricted Access\\n\\nEmotional Responses\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n6\\n\\nEO\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n21\\n\\nSessions\\n\\n26\\n\\n31\\n\\n36\\n\\n41\\n\\nAO2\\n\\nGen EO\\n\\nGen AO1\\n\\nGen AO2\\n\\nAO1\\n\\nUnusual Scenarios\\n\\nFig. 1 Percentage of correct responses during EO trials, AO1 trials, AO2 trials, and generalization probes\\nacross each scenario for Gianna\\n\\nvideo presentation of emotional responding).

This might contribute\\nto a more thorough understanding of the functions of these mands and how we might\\nteach them more effectively and efficiently to children with ASD. Finally, clinicians\\nmight take advantage of EOs specific to their clients to teach this mand. For example,\\nsome children with ASD who experience changes in their routine as particularly\\naversive may have a strong EO for learning about reasons for those changes.\\n\\nTrial-unique multiple-exemplar training was used to promote accurate stimulus/EO\\ncontrol and generalization. First, in the restricted access condition, 12 preferred items and a\\nminimum of three unavailability statements were used. Second, in the emotional responses\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\ncondition, four different peers and seven different emotions were used. Third, in the\\nunusual events condition, four different locations and 60 different events were used.\\nAlthough this required much planning and time, this cost may be deemed worth the\\nbenefit of rapid acquisition, generalization, maintenance, and accurate EO control of this\\nmand. Future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more\\nefficiently. For example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide\\ndifferent reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the\\nceiling). However, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular\\nscenario, the participant may not have an EO to mand “why?” in the future for the\\nsame/similar scenario. Additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant\\nto continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided.\\n\\nTo bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information\\nas the consequence for the mand. However, we speculated that we might be able to\\nenhance the value of the consequences we provided; we did this in different ways in\\neach condition. In the restricted access condition, during EO and AO1 trials, although\\nparticipants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in\\nthe same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). In the emotional\\nresponding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the\\nnumber of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other\\nstudents, and to increase attending. We also thought pausing the video after showing\\nthe emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the\\nresponding would be particularly reinforcing. Finally, in the unusual events condition,\\nwe delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people\\nask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem.\\nClinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and\\nconsequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer\\ncontrol.\\n\\nThe purpose of having two AO conditions rather than just one as in previous studies\\n(e.g., Howlett et al., 2011; Landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under\\nthe control of an EO and not something about the experimental preparation. The two\\nAO conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced-\\nent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. During AO1 trials, participants\\nwere provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have\\nan item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual\\nevent) so there was no EO for manding “why?” During AO2 trials, participants were\\nimmediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response\\nor unusual scenario so there was no EO for manding “why?” We deemed this important\\nfor promoting EO control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. Future\\nstudies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. A second function of the AO2\\ntrials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access\\ncondition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific\\nitems they manded for. That is, without AO2 trials, manding would have always\\nresulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only\\nhave alternative items. This would not have resembled the natural environment and\\ncould have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time.\\n\\nA voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts. All participants mastered the\\nmand “why?” after the full-script condition, and it was unnecessary to use the partial-\\n\\n\\x0cThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior (2021) 37:1–16\\n\\n15\\n\\nscript condition for any of the participants. A voice recorder was used to deliver echoic\\nprompts, rather than in vivo vocal models, as it has been suggested that the former may\\nbe easier to fade (Howlett et al., 2011). Future studies might compare the effectiveness,\\nefficiency, and social validity of these types of prompts. It should be noted that all\\nparticipants in the current study had prior exposure to prompts via voice recorders and\\nto choice boards and also displayed specific skills relevant to the scenarios (i.e., joint\\nattention, tacting emotional responses). Clinicians should assess necessary prerequisite\\nskills for potential learners, as it may help with faster and efficient skill acquisition and\\nalso help with effective prompts and prompt-fading strategies.\\n\\nFor all participants, manding “why?” maintained 1 week after mastery. During the\\nweek between mastery and the maintenance probe, teachers provided at least two\\nopportunities to practice manding “why?” each day to assist with maintenance over\\ntime. Successful maintenance may have resulted from teaching during the study and/or\\npracticing during the week.\\n\\nSocial validity was assessed via a modified version of the TARF-R (Reimers &\\nWacker, 1988) and indicated that the procedures used in this study were time consum-\\ning for the experimenter but acceptable to achieve the desired results. Although the\\nprocedures for the current study were complex, all participants acquired the mand\\n“why?” in all three scenarios and also maintained the skill after 1 week. The total\\nnumber of sessions for all three participants did not exceed 21 sessions.\\n\\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\\n\\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\\n\\nEthical approval All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance\\nwith the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki\\ndeclaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\\n\\nInformed consent\\n\\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

This paper argues that Allen's proof is not correct when schedules are presented in pairs and that his initial assumptions are too restrictive when all schedules are simultaneously available. (Score: 0.6605)\n",
      "The matching law may be viewed either as an empirical generalization, and therby subject to disproof, or as part of a system of equations used to define the utility (“value”) of a reinforcer. In the latter case it is tautologous, and not subject to disproof within the defining context. A failure to obtain matching will most often be a signal that the independent variables have not been properly scaled. If, however, the proper transformations have been made on the independent variables, and matching is not obtained, the experimental paradigm may be outside the purview of the matching law. At that point, reinterpretations or revisions of the law are called for. The theoretical matching law is but one of many possible ways to define utility, and it may eventually be rejected in favor of a more useful definition. (Score: 0.6527)\n",
      "Herrnstein's matching theory requires the parameter, k, which appears in the single-alternative form of the matching equation, to remain invariant with respect to changes in reinforcement parameters like magnitude or immediacy. Recent experiments have disconfirmed matching theory by showing that the invariant-k requirement does not hold. However, the theory can be asserted in a purely algebraic form that does not require an invariant k and that is not disconfirmed by the recent findings. In addition, both the original and the purely algebraic versions of matching theory can be asserted in forms that allow for commonly observed deviations from matching (bias, undermatching, and overmatching). The recent finding of a variable k does not disconfirm these versions of matching theory either. As a consequence, matching remains a viable theory of behavior, the strength of which lies in its general conceptualization of all behavior as choice, and in its unified mathematical treatment of single- and multialternative environments. (Score: 0.6419)\n",
      "The matching law implies that any form of behavior approaches an asymptotic frequency as its reinforcement approaches 100 per cent of the total reinforcement being obtained at a given time. This asymptote is formally independent of the kind or quantity of drive or reinforcement associated with the response in question or with any competing response. (Score: 0.6391)\n",
      "Classic matching theory, which is based on Herrnstein's (1961) original matching equation and includes the well-known quantitative law of effect, is almost certainly false. The theory is logically inconsistent with known experimental findings, and experiments have shown that its central constant-k assumption is not tenable. Modern matching theory, which is based on the power function version of the original matching equation, remains tenable, although it has not been discussed or studied extensively. The modern theory is logically consistent with known experimental findings, it predicts the fact and details of the violation of the classic theory's constant-k assumption, and it accurately describes at least some data that are inconsistent with the classic theory.

       "'A within-subject design, using human participants, compared delay discounting functions for real and hypothetical money rewards. Both real and hypothetical rewards were studied across a range that included $10 to $250. For 5 of the 6 participants, no systematic difference in discount rate was observed in response to real and hypothetical choices, suggesting that hypothetical rewards may often serve as a valid proxy for real rewards in delay discounting research. By measuring discounting at an unprecedented range of real rewards, this study has also systematically replicated the robust finding in human delay discounting research that discount rates decrease with increasing magnitude of reward. A hyperbolic decay model described the data better than an exponential model.'"
