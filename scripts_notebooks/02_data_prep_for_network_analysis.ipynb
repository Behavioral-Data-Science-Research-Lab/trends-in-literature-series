(2011), manding “where’s [preferred item]?” resulted in information about the location of the item and subsequent access to it. it may be challenging to apply this tactic to teaching the mand “why?” because learning the reason for an occurrence does not often lead to access to a preferred item. for example, when a child observes something unusual in the environment (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room) and asks “why is that there?” a common consequence is information (e.g., “i’m fixing the light.”) without access to a preferred activity. second, the mand “why?” may be difficult to teach because—similar to the mand “how?”—it is challenging to arrange multiple opportunities for teaching while ensuring that an establishing operation (eo) controls the response. that is, providing a reason for something is typically an abolishing operation (ao) for asking “why?”; hence eos for the mand “why?” should be absent in such scenarios as the information is present. for example, in the scenario described previously, providing information about the reason for the ladder being in the middle of the room decreases the value of that information as a consequence (and abates responses that have resulted in that conse- quence). therefore, that scenario could probably no longer be used as an eo to teach the mand “why?” despite the challenges with developing arrangements to teach the mand “why?” researchers have noted that it is important for children with asd to learn this type of skill because it may allow them to receive important, unknown information from the environment; result in correct completion of tasks; decrease problem behavior; and expand language skills and social opportunities (shillingsburg et al., 2011). therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to children diagnosed with asd. to address the first challenge described previously (i.e., natural reinforcer control), we taught the mand “why?” under three different eo conditions that were selected based on observation of children with asd 'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 3 and typically developing children: (a) restricted access to preferred items, (b) observa- tion of emotional responses, and (c) observation of unusual events. in addition, we systematically included different types of natural consequences in addition to informa- tion during some trials (i.e., help restore the environment, play, and access to an alternative preferred item). to address the second challenge described previously (i.e., sufficient teaching opportunities), we employed a trial-unique procedure (williams, johnston, & saunders, 2006). previous studies have used this strategy to provide sufficient exemplars of novel/unusual events when teaching joint attention skills. for example, gomes, reeve, brothers, reeve, & sidener (2020) used a trial-unique procedure to teach four children with asd to initiate bids for joint attention; presenting a novel event on every trial facilitated eo control of bids. the current study used this strategy of presenting a novel event on every trial to facilitate eo control of the mand “why?” different topographies of the mand “why?” were taught in each condition (e.g., “why can’t i have it?” “why is he/she doing that?” “why is that there?”) to ensure that manding was under the control of the eo for that precise condition rather than being generalized manding resulting from training in another condition. additionally, we speculated that teaching different, specific forms of the mand for each scenario would be more functional for the participants because they would specify to the listener what information to provide. we programmed for generalization using multiple-exemplar training and assessed generalization by interspersing generalization probe trials during each session. main- tenance was assessed 1 week after participants reached the mastery criterion. finally, board certified behavior analysts and special education teachers were asked to assess the social validity of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study. \",\n",
       " \" participants and setting the participants were three children who had been previously diagnosed with asd: gianna (9 years, 11 months), brandon (18 years, 4 months), and ken (8 years, 1 month). all participants attended educational programs that provided comprehensive behavior- analytic instruction. they all demonstrated mastery of manding for preferred items, manding “where?”, imitating a question/phrase with at least five syllables, initiating joint attention with at least one type of response for two scenarios, and waiting 60 s for a preferred item when presented with the instruction “wait.” caregivers and instructors reported that the participants had not learned to mand “why?” and that this was an important skill for them to learn. sessions were conducted in a room in a university- based autism center or in the participant’s home during teaching trials and in other settings in the participant’s natural environment (e.g., outside, library) during generalization probes. preexperimental assessments preference assessment a questionnaire based on the reinforcer assessment for indi- viduals with severe disabilities (fisher, piazza, bowman, & amari, 1996) was '4 the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 administered to parents and teachers of each participant before the study to identify preferred items. the 12 highest ranked items were selected from a paired-stimulus preference assessment (fisher et al., 1992). teachers were also asked to identify an additional 12 items that were similar to the high-preference items (i.e., in the same category) to be used as alternative items during eo trials of the restricted access scenario. access to all high-preference items was restricted to experimental sessions only. skills assessments four skills assessments were conducted to ensure participants demonstrated the skills necessary for inclusion in the study: repeating questions from a voice recorder, initiating joint attention, tacting emotions, and choosing preferred items from a pictorial choice board. all participants responded correctly and indepen- dently during all the following assessments such that no further teaching was required. the voice-recorder assessment evaluated whether the participants vocally imitated three questions played on a voice recorder to ensure the prerecorded prompt used in the study would evoke echoic responding (somers et al., 2014). the questions used in this assessment had four, five, and six syllables (as the models in the study) but did not share any of the same words as the models in the study. the experimenter stood 0.5 m from the participant and played the recorded question for the participant to repeat. a correct response was defined as the participant emitting the complete question correctly and independently within 5 s. the joint attention assessment was used to evaluate whether participants initiated bids for joint attention, as this was a necessary skill for the observation of the unusual events scenario. a correct response was defined as the participant engaging in at least one of these responses within 3 min of an unusual event being encountered as the participant walked through the hallway or outside: pointing to or touching the unusual item, manding for attention (e.g., “look!”), looking at the object and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “umbrella!”). the tact assessment was used to evaluate whether the participants could tact emotions from facial expressions. the experimenter showed 14 photographs of two different people demonstrating seven different facial expressions (used during the study) and asked the participant “what is she/he doing?” a correct response was defined as the participant tacting the emotion correctly and independently within 5 s of the photograph being presented. the choice-board assessment evaluated whether the participants could make choices for preferred items from photographs on a choice board. the experimenter presented a choice board with an array of 12 photographs of items identified in the preference assessment and asked, “what do you want?” a correct response was defined as the participant selecting a picture from the choice board and giving it to the experimenter within 5 s (or pointing to a picture and vocally manding for it within 5 s), selecting the corresponding item from a box, and engaging with the item. materials, scenarios, and scripts to identify scenarios likely to function as eos for information about why something happened, we observed a classroom of 10 preschoolers who ranged from 2.5 to 4 years 'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 5 old. the observation was conducted over 2 days, and each observation period lasted for 3 hr. the experimenter sat at the back of a classroom and observed the preschool students without interacting. results showed that the most common antecedents to asking “why?” were seeing other children engaging in emotional responding (e.g., crying), and being denied access to preferred items and activities. because of this, restricted access to preferred items and observation of emotional responses were selected as two of the scenarios to use in the current study for teaching the mand “why?” we also included a third scenario, unusual events, because the participants had demonstrated bids for joint attention to unusual events in the past. for the restricted access condition, 24 preferred items were used for each participant. for the unusual events condition, 60 different scenarios were used that were deemed to be salient and not likely to occur in the setting in which sessions were conducted (see table 1 for examples). for the emotional responses condition, 48 videos depicting seven emotional responses and different reasons with four different people (i.e., each person recorded 12 videos; see table 2 for examples) and 28 videos depicting routine actions/activities were used. emotional responses were those that all participants could tact and were age appropriate. a voice recorder was used to provide echoic prompts. the scripts used were recorded with a peer of the same gender to provide a socially valid model, and an ipad was used to record all sessions for subsequent data collection. during the restricted access condition, a 30 cm × 35 cm laminated board, affixed with velcro with 12 photographs of items on one side and three photographs of items used for generalization probe trials on the other side, was used as a choice board. a laptop computer was used to show videos during the emotional responses condition. experimental design and data collection a concurrent multiple-baseline design across three scenario types (i.e., restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events) was used to demonstrate the effects of the intervention with each participant. the order of scenario types was counterbalanced across participants (i.e., gianna: restricted access, emotional re- sponses, unusual scenarios; brandon: emotional responses, unusual scenarios, restricted access; ken: unusual scenarios, restricted access, emotional responses). during each trial, the participant’s response was scored as correct or incorrect. a correct response during eo trials was defined as the participant independently saying the full mand for information (i.e., “why is that there?” “why is he/she doing that?” “why can’t i have it?”) within 10 s of the unavailability statement, end of the video, or the participant indicating the unusual event. equivalent mands (e.g., “why is she laughing?”) were also scored as correct. indicating an unusual event was defined as the participant pointing to it or touching it, manding for attention to it (e.g., “look.”), looking at it and then at the experimenter within 5 s, or tacting it (e.g., “umbrella!”). ao1 (abolishing operation 1) trials, in which the information/reason was immediately provided, and ao2 trials, in which the participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events, were scored as incorrect if the participant said “why” at any point during the trial. data were summarized and graphed as the percentage of independent correct responses during eo trials, ao1 trials, ao2 trials, generalization eo trials, generalization ao1 trials, and generalization ao2 trials per session.

'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 7 experimental procedure sessions were conducted up to three times per day, 4–5 days per week. each session consisted of 12 trials: five eo trials, two ao1 trials, two ao2 trials, and generalization probe trials for eo, ao1, and ao2. trials were quasi-randomly ordered every session, with no more than two eo trials in a row. the purpose of eo trials was to contrive an eo to teach the mand “why?” for the particular condition. the purpose of the ao1 and ao2 trials was to demonstrate that manding was under the control of an eo and not something about the experimental preparation. during ao1 trials, participants were immediately provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no eo for manding “why?” during ao2 trials, participants were not exposed to restricted access, emotional responding, or unusual events; that is, they were given immediate access to items after selecting from the choice board, watched a video with no emotional responding, and encountered nothing unusual in the environment, so there was no eo for manding “why?” a trial-unique procedure was used for all three scenarios to maintain the value of information for the mand “why?” within each scenario, relevant features such as preferred items, unavailability statements, reasons, and alternative items (restricted access scenario); emotional responses, people, and reasons (emotional responses sce- nario); and unusual events, reasons, and related actions (unusual events scenario) were counterbalanced across trials and trial types so that manding would not come under the control of any specific features or combination of features. baseline during all trials in baseline sessions of the restricted access scenario, the experimenter presented a choice board with photographs of 12 high-preference items and said “which one do you want?” or “pick one.” during ao1 trials in baseline, when the participant selected from the choice board, the experimenter provided an unavail- ability statement, a reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item. for example, if a participant selected black olives, the experimenter said “oh! you can’t have these because they’re dirty!” threw the black olives away in the trash, said “but you can have these,” and gave the participant green olives. during ao2 trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided immediate access to the item and said “sure! you can have it.” during eo trials in baseline, when the item was selected, the experimenter provided an unavailability statement only (e.g., “you can’t have it.”). if the participant manded “why can’t i have it?” within 10 s, the experimenter provided the reason, put that item away, and offered an alternative, related item as described previously. if the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “ok, let’s see what’s next” and put the items away. during all trials in baseline sessions of the emotional responses scenario, the experimenter showed a video of someone engaging in an emotional response. during ao1 trials in baseline, 10 s after the video ended, the experimenter provided a reason using a tone and facial expression that matched the emotion and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. for example, if a participant watched a video of a girl laughing, the experimenter paused the video and said “she’s laughing because someone tickled her!” and played the next part of the '8 the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 video that showed someone tickling the girl. during ao2 trials in baseline, a video of someone engaging in a routine action with a neutral expression was shown to the participant. during eo trials in baseline, if the participant manded “why is he/she doing that?” within 10 s of the video ending, the experimenter provided the reason as described previously. if the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “ok, let’s see what’s next.” during all trials of baseline sessions of the unusual events scenario, the experimenter walked with the participant to a different room or hallway or outside. during ao1 trials in baseline, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter provided a reason for it being there and an action related to it. for example, if a participant opened his or her backpack and found a pillow, the experimenter said “this says ‘meghan’—meghan must have left this here—let’s go put it in her office” and walked with the participant to meghan’s office to put it there. during ao2 trials in baseline, there was nothing unusual in the environment. for example, when a participant walked into the classroom and there was nothing unusual, the participant continued with his or her daily schedule. during eo trials in baseline, if the participant correctly manded “why is that there?” within 10 s, the experimenter immediately provided a reason and continued as described previously. if the participant did not mand correctly within 10 s, the experimenter said something equivalent to “ok, let’s see what’s next.” mand training training sessions were identical to baseline sessions with the following exceptions. during eo trials of the restricted access scenario, when the participant selected the item, the experimenter immediately provided an unavailability statement and played the recorded prompt “why can’t i have it?” out of the participant’s view. after the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and offered an alternative item in a similar category. during eo trials of the emotional responses scenario, 10 s after the participant watched the video, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “why is he/she doing that?” out of the participant’s view. after the participant successfully echoed the model, the experimenter immediately provided the reason and played the next part of the video that showed the reason for the emotional responding. for example, after the participant watched the first part of the video, which showed a boy hurt (i.e., saying “ouch!”), and successfully echoed the recorded prompt, the experimenter immediately said “he’s hurt because the door shut on his finger!” and played the second part of the video showing the reason the boy was hurt (i.e., his finger getting caught in the door). during eo trials of the unusual events scenario, within 10 s of the participant indicating the unusual event, the experimenter played the recorded prompt “why is that there?” out of the participant’s view. after the participant engaged in the echoic, the experimenter immediately provided an appropriate reason and then suggested (a) helping to fix the situation, (b) playing with the item, or (c) nothing else. after meeting criterion during the full-script condition (i.e., 100% correct responding with or without scripts for two consecutive sessions), a baseline (no-script) probe was conducted to test for independent manding. if a participant responded at 100% accuracy for two consecutive sessions independently, the skill was considered mastered. generalization to assess generalization, three generalization trials were conducted under baseline conditions during each session. these trials were conducted by novel 'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 9 instructors or caregivers (i.e., familiar to the participant but not involved in the study) in novel settings (e.g., outside, on a walk, in the library). during eo trials of the restricted access scenario, we used a different colored choice board with photographs of three items that were not identified via the preference assessment but were nominated by teachers/caregivers as items that were manded for on a daily basis. during eo trials of the emotional responses scenario, a novel instructor acted out emotional responses in vivo. during eo trials of the unusual events scenario, novel unusual events occurred. for all ao1 and ao2 trials during generalization for all three scenarios, procedures similar to baseline were followed. maintenance maintenance probes were conducted 1 week after a participant reached the mastery criterion, and followed the same procedures as baseline. instructors/ caregivers were asked to provide two opportunities to mand for each scenario for the eo condition and two opportunities for the ao1 and ao2 conditions each day between the conclusion of the study and the maintenance probe. interobserver agreement and procedural integrity interobserver agreement (ioa) data were collected for 50% of baseline sessions, intervention sessions, and maintenance sessions. an agreement was defined as both observers recording a trial as correct or incorrect. ioa was calculated using point-by- point agreement by dividing the number of agreements over the total number of agreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100%. ioa was 100% for all three participants. procedural integrity data were taken during 50% of all baseline, intervention, and maintenance sessions for all three participants by secondary observers via video recordings. a trial was scored as correct if all of the following were correct: statements, prompts, consequences, materials, and timing. procedural integrity data were calculated by dividing the total number of correct trials over the total number of correct and incorrect trials and multiplying by 100%. mean procedural integrity was 98% (range 97%–100%) for brandon and 100% for gianna and ken. social validity three special education teachers and two board certified behavior analysts were given brief descriptions of the procedures and shown videos of each condition. they completed a modified treatment acceptability rating form–revised (tarf-r; reimers & wacker, 1988), which uses a 7-point likert-type scale (1 = disagree strongly; 7 = agree strongly). results data on the percentage of correct responses for all participants are presented in figs. 1 through 3. as can be seen in fig. 1, during baseline gianna responded correctly during ao1 and ao2 trials and did not mand “why?” during eo trials. during mand training '10 the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 in the restricted access to preferred items condition (top panel), gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. although she did not ask “why?” during two eo trials (sessions 13 and 15), asked “where’s [item]?” during one ao1 trial (session 14), and asked “why?” during one ao1 trial (session 15), no procedural modifications were needed. when the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in two sessions. during mand training in the emotional responses condition (middle panel), gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script in six sessions. when the script was removed, she met the mastery criterion in three sessions. during mand training in the unusual events condition (bottom panel), gianna reached the mastery criterion with the full script and with the script removed in two sessions each. as can be seen in the top panel of fig. 2, during baseline of the emotional responses condition, brandon responded correctly during ao1 and ao2 trials and did not mand “why?” during eo trials. he did not ask “why?” during five eo trials (sessions 11 and 17) and asked “why?” during one ao1 trial (session 17). he reached the mastery criterion with the full script in five sessions and with the script removed in three sessions. a similar pattern was observed in the unusual events condition (middle panel): he reached the mastery criterion with the full script in four sessions and with the script removed in two sessions. a different pattern was observed during the restricted access condition. although his caregivers reported that he had not previously learned to mand “why?” and he did not mand “why?” during baseline of the other conditions, during the first four sessions of baseline of the restricted access condition (bottom panel), brandon manded “why not?” “how come?” and “why can’t i have [item]?” during 50% of eo trials. however, he also made errors during 50% of eo trials, 50% of ao1 trials, and 100% of eo generalization trials of those sessions (i.e., for the ao1 trials, brandon manded “why?” even when the instructor provided a reason, and for the eo trials and the eo generalization trials, brandon did not mand “why?”). after reaching the mastery criterion in the emotional responses condition (i.e., top panel), he subsequently scored 100% during all trials of the next four sessions in the restricted access condition without teaching. as can be seen in fig. 3, during baseline ken responded correctly during ao1 and ao2 trials and did not mand “why?” during eo trials. during mand training in the unusual events condition (top panel), he reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in five sessions and for the no-script condition in four sessions. during this scenario, ken asked “why?” during two ao1 trials (sessions 10 and 17). during mand training in the restricted access condition (middle panel), ken reached the mastery criterion for the full-script condition in three sessions and for the no-script condition in two sessions. similarly, in the emotional responses condition, he reached the mastery criterion for both the full-script and no-script conditions in two sessions each. as with acquisition, all participants demonstrated generalized manding quickly. only one participant, ken, made an error during a generalization trial of the no-script condition. during session 18, during the ao1 trial, after the experimenter provided the reason for the unusual event, ken asked “where should the star bucket go?” interestingly, during the full-script condition of the emotional responses condition, gianna initially engaged in errors during generalization eo trials and generalization ao1 trials and responded with laughter and stereotypy (e.g., when the novel instructor acted out the scenario for surprise, gianna started laughing and talking about a cartoon video clip). subsequently, a procedural modification was made during sessions 23, 24, and 25 to temporarily make the generalization conditions (i.e., in vivo presentation of emotional responding) more like the teaching conditions (i.e., 'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 11 baseline       full script no

training video of emotional responding. following session 25, this modification was removed, and gianna subsequently met the mastery criterion within two sessions. all skills remained at 100% correct for all participants during maintenance probes 1 week later. on the modified tarf-r, respondents rated the social validity of the intervention with an overall mean of 5.88 (range 1–7). discussion the purpose of the current study was to evaluate procedures for teaching the mand “why?” to three children with asd. all participants learned and maintained a repertoire of '12 the analysis of verbal

(full-script plus no-script) sessions and trials: gianna in 21 sessions, 252 trials; brandon in 4 sessions, 168 trials; and ken in 18 sessions, 216 trials. to our knowledge, this is the first published study to evaluate procedures for teaching this skill to this population. these findings replicate and extend other research on teaching mands for information that contrived eo and ao trials (e.g., howlett et al., 2011; shillingsburg & valentino, 2011). the current study included three types of scenarios—restricted access to preferred items, emotional responses, and unusual events—to teach the mand “why?” these scenarios were selected based on observation of typically developing children and the participants. future studies might evaluate other types of scenarios that might evoke the mand “why?” although we conducted a descriptive assessment with preschool children over 2 days (6 hr), we only observed two types of antecedents for this mand. it is 'the analysis of verbal

typically developing children. it would also be helpful for behavior analysts to collect objective data on topographies and common antecedents and consequences of this mand (and other mands for information) as they emerge in typically developing children. this might contribute to a more thorough understanding of the functions of these mands and how we might teach them more effectively and efficiently to children with asd. finally, clinicians might take advantage of eos specific to their clients to teach this mand. for example, some children with asd who experience changes in their routine as particularly aversive may have a strong eo for learning about reasons for those changes. trial-unique multiple-exemplar training was used to promote accurate stimulus/eo control and generalization. first, in the restricted access condition, 12 preferred items and a minimum of three unavailability statements were used. second, in the emotional responses '14 the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 condition, four different peers and seven different emotions were used. third, in the unusual events condition, four different locations and 60 different events were used. although this required much planning and time, this cost may be deemed worth the benefit of rapid acquisition, generalization, maintenance, and accurate eo control of this mand. future studies are needed to determine if similar results can be obtained more efficiently. for example, it may be possible to use the same/similar scenarios and provide different reasons (e.g., a ladder in the middle of the room: fixing the light, painting the ceiling). however, it is important to note that once the reason is provided for a particular scenario, the participant may not have an eo to mand “why?” in the future for the same/similar scenario. additionally, it may not be deemed socially valid for the participant to continue manding “why?” in the same situation after the reason has been provided. to bring “why?” under natural reinforcer control, we always provided information as the consequence for the mand. however, we speculated that we might be able to enhance the value of the consequences we provided; we did this in different ways in each condition. in the restricted access condition, during eo and ao1 trials, although participants did not receive the preferred items manded for, they were given an item in the same category (e.g., different type of cookie, olive, chocolate). in the emotional responding condition, we used videos instead of in vivo presentation to decrease the number of staff needed for teaching, to have models that could be used with other students, and to increase attending. we also thought pausing the video after showing the emotional responding and then pressing play to show the event that caused the responding would be particularly reinforcing. finally, in the unusual events condition, we delivered three types of consequences we anecdotally observed to occur after people ask “why?”: information only, interacting with the items, and helping fix the problem. clinicians and researchers might consider other types of scenario presentations and consequences that would be reinforcing for participants and promote natural reinforcer control. the purpose of having two ao conditions rather than just one as in previous studies (e.g., howlett et al., 2011; landa et al., 2017) was to establish that manding was under the control of an eo and not something about the experimental preparation. the two ao conditions also allowed for assessment and demonstration of appropriate anteced- ent control for the mand “why?” for all three scenarios. during ao1 trials, participants were provided with a reason relevant to each condition (i.e., why they could not have an item, why a person was having an emotional response, why there was an unusual event) so there was no eo for manding “why?” during ao2 trials, participants were immediately given access to the preferred item or not exposed to an emotional response or unusual scenario so there was no eo for manding “why?” we deemed this important for promoting eo control; however, it is possible that they were unnecessary. future studies might evaluate the necessity of these conditions. a second function of the ao2 trials that we speculated might be particularly important for the restricted access condition was that they ensured that the participants sometimes received the specific items they manded for. that is, without ao2 trials, manding would have always resulted in being told they could not have the specific item they chose and could only have alternative items. this would not have resembled the natural environment and could have potentially resulted in manding decreasing over time. a voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts. all participants mastered the mand “why?” after the full-script condition, and it was unnecessary to use the partial- 'the analysis of verbal behavior (2021) 37:1–16 15 script condition for any of the participants. a voice recorder was used to deliver echoic prompts, rather than in vivo vocal models, as it has been suggested that the former may be easier to fade (howlett et al., 2011). future studies might compare the effectiveness, efficiency, and social validity of these types of prompts. it should be noted that all participants in the current study had prior exposure to prompts via voice recorders and to choice boards and also displayed specific skills relevant to the scenarios (i.e., joint attention, tacting emotional responses). clinicians should assess necessary prerequisite skills for potential learners, as it may help with faster and efficient skill acquisition and also help with effective prompts and prompt-fading strategies. for all participants, manding “why?” maintained 1 week after mastery. during the week between mastery and the maintenance probe, teachers provided at least two opportunities to practice manding “why?” each day to assist with maintenance over time. successful maintenance may have resulted from teaching during the study and/or practicing during the week. social validity was assessed via a modified version of the tarf-r (reimers & wacker, 1988) and indicated that the procedures used in this study were time consum- ing for the experimenter but acceptable to achieve the desired results. although the procedures for the current study were complex, all participants acquired the mand “why?” in all three scenarios and also maintained the skill after 1 week. the total number of sessions for all three participants did not exceed 21 sessions. compliance with ethical standards conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict
